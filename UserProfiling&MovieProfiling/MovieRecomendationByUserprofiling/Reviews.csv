337978,Live Free or Die Hard may work better for an audience that doesnt know much about the series than it will for Die Hard die hards who will be wondering who that impersonator is and what he did with the real John McClane.,Live Free or Die Hard

118040,A B-grade murder mystery with a sci-fi twist.,Unforgettable
116483,[A] one-joke Caddyshack for the blitzed and jaded.,Happy Gilmore
116483,There are about three minutes of funny material in Happy Gilmore and pretty much all of them are in the trailer.,Happy Gilmore
116483,Superior disposable comedy.,Happy Gilmore
116483,It may smell awful from a distance especially if you have low tolerance for lowbrow humor but up close this yarn about an unlikely golf star is fairly painless.,Happy Gilmore
116483,You dont feel that Sandler and director Dennis Dugan are trying for the kind of subversiveness that might just make Happys brutal anarchy more effective.,Happy Gilmore
116483,Happys tantrums which the movie pretends are liberating explosions of self-expression arent nearly maniacal enough to reach comic delirium.,Happy Gilmore
116483,Sandler plays this a lot smarter than say a Jim Carrey character and with less slapstick. Still this is not delicate subtle stuff: Its smart low-brow and only for those who like their humor a bit offbeat.,Happy Gilmore
116483,The story has all the thickness of a well-trimmed green but its a decent excuse for some heady sight gags.,Happy Gilmore
116483,The Happy Gilmore character is strange. I guess we are supposed to like him.,Happy Gilmore
116483,Happy Gilmore may not be an ace in the hole but it beats par by a long shot.,Happy Gilmore
116483,Sandlers movie is worth a few laughs but not many of the comic sequences are original and even fewer are inspired.,Happy Gilmore
112579,With Eastwood as Kincaid and Meryl Streep as Francesca this carefully observant love story turns Wallers pop-lit passion into screen art.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Bridges is an admirable achievement one that probably does more to reposition its maker as someone who can carry a movie without carrying a gun than as the director/star of a Love Story for the Loving Care set.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,The result if rather thin and certainly far from a masterpiece is nevertheless quite lovely. This affecting little film is easily one of Eastwoods best efforts as a director.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,The two leads sly comic rhythm is miles removed from the books failing solemnity.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Eastwoods Bridges has the energy and spontaneity of a picture that was shot quickly. And that serves the material well because it removes the solemnity that could stiffle a modern classic.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Despite all his craft and sincerity [Eastwood] and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese cant quite turn Robert James Wallers cardboard best-seller into flesh and bone.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Bridges is an old-fashioned womens film that pits the heroines romantic urges against her matriarchal duties. In fact the film is at its dramatic best when Francesca is finally obliged like Sophie to make her choice.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Streep makes her character known in no time flat. Intelligence humor blocked ambition self-irony -- theyre all contained in Francescas quick response when Robert asks if she has any plans for the afternoon.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood as Wallers tenderly plaintive heartland lovers are so visually and spiritually right they seem to have walked right off the page.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,What follows is essentially gothic-romantic bunk. But theres a nicely stylized below-the-surface courtship between the performers. They make you forget that at their very core they are hackneyed creations.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Madison County is Eastwoods gift to women: to Francesca to all the girls hes loved before -- and to Streep who alchemizes literary mawkishness into intelligent movie passion.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Given the intelligent restraint of the treatment this is about as fine an adaptation of this material as one could hope for...,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Immaculately performed and assembled with wit and sensitivity this is one of the most satisfying weepies in years.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Limited by the vapidity of this material while he trims its excesses with the requisite machete Mr. Eastwood locates a moving elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Wallers self-congratulatory overkill.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,What the movie does that the book couldnt do is tap into the poignancy that comes of seeing two stars who used to be young and beautiful suddenly looking very mortal.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Screenwriter LaGravenese ought to get the Croix de Guerre for doing battle with Wallers fatuous prose and paring Bridges down to its most appealing fantasy romance essence.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,The Bridges of Madison County is a beautiful film not only in the way it was photographed but for the manner through which the characters are revealed to us.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,Ive seen the movie twice now and was even more involved the second time because I was able to pay more attention to the nuances of voice and gesture.,The Bridges of Madison County
112579,The gap between touchy-feely and touching isnt easy to span so credit judicious pruning on the one hand and a beefed-up script on the other for getting perhaps the best possible movie out of Robert James Wallers The Bridges of Madison County.,The Bridges of Madison County
117110,Geena Davis and Renny Harlin couldnt cut it with Cutthroat Island. Steven Spielberg nearly got the hook for Hook. But leave it to Miss Piggy and Kermit to discover uncharted gold in the shipwrecked-pirate genre.,Muppet Treasure Island
112573,In this mix of historical tragedy and hip adventure Gibson may be as galvanic a movie swashbuckler as Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster were in their day.,Braveheart
112573,The political argument that ensues is pretty dull but the battle scenes are the loudest and most convincing in years: Gibson has learned from Kurosawa in lending a clarifying thrust to what is essentially chaos.,Braveheart
112573,Braveheart looks like a true epic -- even if it is both bloody and bloody long.,Braveheart
112573,A huge bloody and sprawling epic Braveheart is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didnt essentially deliver.,Braveheart
112573,Pure hokum.,Braveheart
112573,Though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess the action will pin you to your seat.,Braveheart
112573,As a filmmaker [Gibson] lacks the epic gift but the movie scripted by Randall (no relation) Wallace works on a fairly basic level as a hiss-the-English medieval Western.,Braveheart
112573,Braveheart opts to turn cowardly settling for the magnification of Gibsons idol status forfeiting the complex more nebulous magnificence of the real Sir William Wallace and virtually excising the strategic brilliance of Robert The Bruce.,Braveheart
112573,Theres a matter-of-fact grittiness about Braveheart that infects even its occasional touches of mysticism and photogenic romance.,Braveheart
112573,At times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo.,Braveheart
112573,Gibsons raw energy and storytelling power in Braveheart are undeniable. If the film doesnt meet his ambitions its because he set the bar so high.,Braveheart
112573,With its clashing armies heartstopping action and grand sense of romance this is the sort of film its a pleasure to see and review.,Braveheart
112573,An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of The Road Warrior.,Braveheart
112573,A rambling disappointment.,Braveheart
112573,One of the most spectacular entertainments in years.,Braveheart
112573,[Gibson] has created a completely adequate modern facsimile of the classic romantic epic.,Braveheart
112573,Though lumpy and even redundant Braveheart constantly rebounds on some bold note.,Braveheart
112573,Everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars contracts. Too bad there isnt one banning self-indulgence when they direct.,Braveheart
112573,It takes a real star to make suffering this sexy.,Braveheart
75314,Its a powerful film and a terrific showcase for the versatility of star Robert De Niro.,Taxi Driver
75314,Bickle is complex intriguing and never one-note.,Taxi Driver
75314,Like Werner Herzogs Aguirre or Coppolas Apocalypse Now Taxi Driver is auteurist psychodrama.,Taxi Driver
75314,[Scorsese] seems to need scripts with well-designed humor and performers with the spirit of Ellen Burstyn to compensate for what seems to be a fundamentally depressed view of life and the belief that sobriety is the equivalent of seriousness.,Taxi Driver
75314,New York may have changed but Taxi Driver is as powerful and painful as ever.,Taxi Driver
75314,Martin Scorseses history-making scald is truly a phenomenon from another day and age. Which is to say imagine a like-minded film of this decade killing at the box office and getting nommed for Best Picture.,Taxi Driver
75314,You may want to argue with Taxi Driver at the end and with good reason but it wont be a waste of time.,Taxi Driver
75314,Since the mid-1970s the movie has become presciently emblematic of our emotionally diseased violence-prone culture.,Taxi Driver
75314,The heart and soul of Taxi Driver are twisted in a way that cant be faked or copied.,Taxi Driver
75314,One of the best and most powerful of all films.,Taxi Driver
75314,A masterful psychological study the depth of which can only fully be appreciated on repeat viewings.,Taxi Driver
75314,Perhaps the most formally ravishing-as well as the most morally and ideologically problematic-film ever directed by Martin Scorsese the 1976 Taxi Driver remains a disturbing landmark for the kind of voluptuous doublethink it helped ratify.,Taxi Driver
113326,Chans insistence on his own fallibility and vulnerability taken with virtuoso scenes like the fight involving 101 domestic appliances shows why he means more to his countless fans than six US action stars put together.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,Its light on plot and character but the stunts are well staged.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,For once a films ad line has a whiff of truth about it: No Fear. No Stuntman. No Equal.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,The fun of Rumble in the Bronx is watching Chan build up one inventive and off-the-wall action scene after another.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,An awkward hybrid of Asian and American film techniques.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,The whole point is Jackie Chan - and like Astaire and Rogers he does what he does better than anybody.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,Its not often you find a movie as exciting and awful as Rumble in the Bronx.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,Unlike most action stars Chan understands acting. His face is as flexible as his body and when hes moving hes like a violent supercharged combination of Gene Kelly Fred Astaire and Buster Keaton.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,You can smirk at Rumble and deny its pedigree with some justification as long as you concede that its 10 times more fun to watch than Before and After and Mary Reilly put together.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,Awe-inspiring.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,The very medium of the moving picture exists to create the suspension of disbelief and there is no greater live performer than Chan to make us believe you can beat up a street gang with a linen jacket and refrigerators.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,A giddy triple somersault of a film that makes no sense whatsoever although in its best moments it is as much fun to watch as a death-defying circus act.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,More than a martial arts whiz the 41-year-old Chan possesses the comic timing of a born clown the grace of a Broadway hoofer and the daredevil bravado of an Evel Knievel.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,The film may look amateurish but the camera-work is fluid the best to catch Chans choreography.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,As the star cheerfully camouflages massive bandages on a twisted ankle we also get a glimpse of just how far Chan is willing to go to please his audience.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,As the guy who cleans up a ghetto helps a crippled kid and does battle with a rampaging Hovercraft Chan shows off the muscle of a superhero and the charm of a deft comedian.,Rumble in the Bronx
113326,Chan doing everything at once including all his own stunts has an infectious energy that will help to remind you why you love movies.,Rumble in the Bronx
115645,Despite Meryl Streep Liam Neeson and the usually estimable Edward Furlong this nonevent huffs and puffs to attain even the level of an ordinary motion picture.,Before and After

112373,Remarkable deeply moving work that attempts to answer the haunting question Who was Anne Frank?,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,If the story of each of Hitlers victims was told with the sensitivity and power of Anne Frank Remembered there would not be enough buckets in the world to hold all the tears.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,Annes story of courage in the face of horrendous circumstances is a fine legacy and Anne Frank Remembered reaffirms how relevant her message is today.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,The films accumulated force is a testament to the power of understatement.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,Anne Frank Remembered tells the audience very little about Anne but the film speaks volumes concerning the problematic aspects of Holocaust representation.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,In the films most extraordinary discovery we see the only existing film footage of Anne Frank taken one day in 1941 before the Franks went into hiding.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,If this is not the best film about the Holocaust it does strongly chronicle the sad fate of one of its most famous victims.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,The interviews constitute the emotional backbone. The mere existence of these survivors is eloquent testimony to events so cruel they defy belief.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,Of all the movies and television productions that have told her story this is the most valuable and satisfying.,Anne Frank Remembered
112373,In retracing the short life and grotesque death of the centurys best known diarist Anna Frank it has its own private dignity.,Anne Frank Remembered

103859,In Boomerang Eddie Murphy straitjackets himself in an ill-fitting comedy vehicle thats desperately in need of a reality check.,Boomerang
103859,The general idea is to exploit a certain amount of role reversal and Reginald Hudlin who directed House Party does a fairly good job of making this fun.,Boomerang
103859,The film is far too slick to be ineffective but its attempts to play with the sex-war theme are often unbelievably crass.,Boomerang
103859,Theres something paradoxical about the ease he radiates in playing a man who is supposed to be a smashing success. As an underdog Mr. Murphy worked much harder.,Boomerang
103859,For all the sex talk in Boomerang theres very little nudity. The only thing naked is Murphys vanity.,Boomerang

109424,As fresh as falling rain a pair of love stories full of pain and humor.,Chungking Express
109424,Its interesting enough to watch for most of its length because of Wongs incisive camera work and his intense immersion of the Hong Kong night culture.,Chungking Express
109424,This is the kind of movie youll relate to if you love film itself rather than its surface aspects such as story and stars.,Chungking Express
109424,Once the viewer gets past bouts of confusion (the film demands more than one viewing) the result is a uniquely memorable look at the ties that bind all people.,Chungking Express

116324,David O. Russell has a twisted mind; I like that in a man.,Flirting With Disaster
116324,This whacked-out road comedy about a young mans search for his real parents takes any number of unexpected turns most of them bitingly funny.,Flirting With Disaster
116324,The neurotic frenzy threatens to annoy but Russells edgy abbreviated style generates farcical comic friction without sacrificing character.,Flirting With Disaster
116324,There are conventions in this sort of story and Russell seems to violate most of them. He allows the peculiarities of his characters to lead them away from the plot line and into perplexities of their own.,Flirting With Disaster
116324,Hang on and prepare to laugh continually.,Flirting With Disaster
116324,The perpetual motion is a deliciously hysterical rush. This offbeat documentary-like comedy becomes geometrically funnier as it goes along.,Flirting With Disaster

145653,Theres a compelling momentum to Angelas Ashes Alan Parkers very faithful if poetically subordinate version of McCourts book which imposed elegance on squalor and intelligence on the indolence cultivated by poverty.,Angela's Ashes

256524,The romance between C.W. and Betty Ann doesnt have much ardor repressed or otherwise.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Mid-level pretty-but-not- hugely-funny Allen film.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Its evidently important to Allen to work work work but hes starting to make his movies by rote instead of passion.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,[Allens] let his guard down and has allowed himself and his audience to relax -- something that doesnt often happen when the specters of class and European art hover over his pictures.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Despite an appealing even ingenious premise Scorpion is another quippy but uninspired comedy.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,The director may be coasting with Jade Scorpion but audiences will likely have too much fun to care.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Many of the jokes fall flat and the film has a musty smell about it like an apartment someone has been living in for too long. Yet the picture plays out pleasantly and Allen creates a world thats easy to inhabit.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,In spite of its dated ways -- or perhaps because of them -- it just may be the most youthful film youll see this summer.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,About as insignificant as a movie can be without blowing right off the screen.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,The frothiest funniest comedy he has made since Manhattan Murder Mystery.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Enormous fun.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,This new one has a clever premise is well-acted and has a polished deliberately antiquated look but it elicits more shrugs than laughs.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Feels like an exercise in seasoned craft with an occasional good line which cant help seeming hugely lacking in ambition. Theres a prevailing sense that the wind has gone out of Allens artistic sails.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,The title is to be sure delightful but the movie itself is finally a trifle.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,In nearly four decades of filmmaking Woody Allen has been hilarious brilliant maddening contrary and unsettling. Never though has he been so ordinary.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,The movie is a pleasure to watch the craft is voluptuous to regard but The Curse of the Jade Scorpion lacks the elusive zing of inspiration.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion
256524,Theres nothing major here certainly nothing on the order of my favorite among Allens retro workouts of the past decade Bullets Over Broadway. But its entertaining all the same.,The Curse of the Jade Scorpion

116130,The tone of the acting which is set by Mr. Grammers blandly laid-back performance is all wrong for a genre that demands over-the-top hamming.,Down Periscope

116130,After that auspicious opening it sinks.,Down Periscope
116130,There are occasional laughs but as with most movies that think theyre funnier than they actually are most of the jokes fall flat.,Down Periscope
483726,Levinson has written and directed in many genres. But rarely has he made a film as indecisive and diffident as Man of the Year.,Man of the Year
483726,A surprisingly complex and dark satire that skewers the media as well as the political process.,Man of the Year
483726,Man of the Year makes telling points and has a lot to say but it loses its voice along with its consistency around the mid-way point and that will likely make it an also-ran in the box office race.,Man of the Year
483726,Its a comedy a political thriller a love story: Barry Levinsons Man of the Year tries to be all things to all people and fails on every count -- a little like the generic ineffectual politicians its pretending to excoriate.,Man of the Year

483726,A genre-less imaginative riff by an intelligent filmmaker on the state of the country.,Man of the Year
483726,Its a nearly tone-deaf satire of American politics and the culture of celebrity a comedy without enough laughs a satire without enough bite.,Man of the Year
483726,Only in filmmaking does one very good idea plus another very good idea sometimes add up to one less-than-great picture.,Man of the Year
483726,Man of the Year is longer than the FDR administration less funny than Calvin Coolidge and deader than Abe Lincoln.,Man of the Year
483726,A few moments do not make a new Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Frank Capra can continue to rest in peace.,Man of the Year
483726,The second half of Man of the Year bears practically no relation to the irreverent comedy the movies trailer sells you -- much like a politician who doesnt keep any of the promises that lured you to vote for him.,Man of the Year
483726,Man of the Year isnt Movie of the Year. It might have been an ironic condemnation of electoral fraud and the malignant sway of corporate profits. But for a while anyway it had my vote.,Man of the Year
483726,Man of the Year is a moderately funny little movie that isnt pointed enough to successfully skewer its political targets.,Man of the Year
483726,Man of the Year is a well-intentioned mess a dated yuk-it-up sloppy civics lesson with such a lack of conviction that it backs away from the very questions it poses.,Man of the Year
483726,No one will mistake Man of the Year for movie of the year but it says some things worth being said without the usual straight face.,Man of the Year
483726,Man of the Year starts out funny -- at least thats the intention -- and then morphs into a kind of paranoid thriller. Neither one of the movies split personalities is particularly good.,Man of the Year
483726,Theres a Preston Sturges lesson in Man of the Year: Entertaining folks is its own civic duty. At times making citizens laugh (and think) might be the most honorable profession of all.,Man of the Year
107076,A disappointing American debut of the Hong Kong cult director John Woo is a decent action vehicle by standards of its star Jean-Claude Van Damme but hampered by a B script and flat characters it doesnt bear Woos auteurist signature and unique vision,Hard Target

107076,Woo a master of stylized violence and explosive action has had to buy into Americas fascination with explosive effects and reaction. Something gets lost in the transition.,Hard Target
107076,Its characters are poorly-developed the plot is the pinnacle of absurdity and the acting at best is well over-the-top. Nevertheless on the most basic visceral level the film succeeds.,Hard Target
107076,Essentially Hard Target is a risk-averse Van Damme vehicle steered by many hands and set on tracks leading directly to the delivery entrances of the countrys video stores.,Hard Target

115685,Far less plastic than most cross-dressing comedies.,The Birdcage
115685,What makes Mike Nichols version more than just a retread is good casting in the key roles and a wicked screenplay by Elaine May who keeps the original story but adds little zingers here and there.,The Birdcage
115685,An American remake with plenty of new pizazz.,The Birdcage
115685,The beauty of The Birdcage is that its jokes and its message are one and the same. These characters couldnt change themselves if they tried. And only a fool would want them to.,The Birdcage
112442,The cops never seem to know what theyre doing but then neither do the filmmakers though I cant imagine that casual audiences will care since there are plenty of big explosions at the end to reward them.,Bad Boys
112442,Even when its not particularly funny their interplay is engaging and their lively raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time.,Bad Boys
112442,Unfortunately the movie is a couple of rewrites short of developed and the thriller configurations are stale.,Bad Boys
112442,This film isnt aiming for high-toned drama just high-energy entertainment which is what it delivers.,Bad Boys
112442,Its all special-effects noise and nonsense.,Bad Boys
112442,Given how much good Bad Boys is going to do for Martin Lawrences feature career its a pity the film couldnt do any more for itself.,Bad Boys
112442,A good half-hours worth of nonsense in the middle keeps Bad Boys from being little better than a break- even proposition.,Bad Boys
112442,This movie is so good-looking it deserves a decent screenplay instead of one more lope down memory lane.,Bad Boys
112442,Even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks this ones bad boys.,Bad Boys
112442,Bad Boys is relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; its loud shallow sexist and a complete waste of time.,Bad Boys
112442,Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road and leads the audience to a dead end.,Bad Boys
112442,Of course the Simpson-Bruckheimer approach may still work at the box office (the only place it ever really mattered anyway). By now though Id like to think most moviegoers have had a permanent overdose.,Bad Boys
112342,Harmless family fare might be deemed politically correct for its concern for endangered species but whitewashing of Chinese regime will strike adults... as somewhat bizarre.,The Amazing Panda Adventure
112342,Pandas are many things. Adorable fuzzballs. Voracious eaters. Vanishing species. But as actors they are black and white and dull all over which The Amazing Panda Adventure demonstrates all too well.,The Amazing Panda Adventure
112461,For those few soul-freezing moments you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,Significantly the movie keeps the heros reformation offscreen as well as unexplained; its more interested in shock effects than in candor or elucidation.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,The angel-faced DiCaprio is a gifted actor but he lacks the authority and physical presence to keep us with him.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,The star shines but the movie is hard to watch.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,You leave The Basketball Diaries believing that Leonardo DiCaprio can do anything.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,Amazingly though even with Kalverts lack of style and vision the greatness of DiCaprios performance is undiminished.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,Will there ever be a market for a movie about a character who hurries past his drug phase because he cant wait to tell you what he did after he pulled his act together? Probably not.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,Facile escapes are rejected and the resolution is acceptable because we can believe it. In fact thats the reason this film works as well as it does: credibility.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,DiCaprio goes as far into the hell of drug abuse as any actor ever has -- and comes out a star.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,A movie for masochists an unrelentingly ugly Just Say No propaganda movie it might have been bankrolled by Nancy Reagan.,The Basketball Diaries
112461,DiCaprio has so much presence that he almost saves the day but this is a movie thatll make you want to opt for Jim Carreys The Basketball Diaries.,The Basketball Diaries
405163,It ranges from awkward to excruciating.,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie)

405163,Do not waste your time with The Amateurs.,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie)
405163,There are no laughs to be found in writer-director Michael Traegers would-be comedy The Amateurs but there is one big mystery: how actors of this caliber could have been convinced to take part.,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie)
405163,As a writer Traeger is consternatingly adolescent and glib.,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie)
405163,Youll notice that the actors are way overqualified for this nonsense. But the kick they get out of one another is what pulls you in.,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie)
405163,If theres something hypocritically coy about a sex comedy without sex (let alone a porn industry without victims) theres also something refreshing about the characters unabashed good nature -- at least until the grievously saccharine finale.,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie)
112384,Even if you know how it all turned out (and you should) this amazing journey is harrowing and exhilarating.,Apollo 13
112384,The film succeeds brilliantly at organizing great gobs of information into powerful drama.,Apollo 13

112384,Apollo 13 one of the most exciting adventure movies of the year proves that science history can be just as thrilling as science fiction.,Apollo 13
112384,Howard is not above pushing buttons of his own and milking the big moments. But they are indeed big moments and the manipulation is not intrusive. He has made a can-do movie for our cant-do age.,Apollo 13
112384,The film despite its raggedness is stirring. In the end this failed mission seems like the most impressive achievement of the entire space program: a triumph not of planning but of inspired improvisation.,Apollo 13
112384,This meticulous but ultimately rather pedestrian drama gradually won me over as a minor if watchable example of the victory through defeat brand of military heroism that John Ford specialized in.,Apollo 13
112384,Self-conscious about its heroism with portrayals that lean toward the glib and the professionally uplifting the film milks our sympathies too readily to be emotionally convincing.,Apollo 13
112384,This engrossing account of the nations most perilous moon shot embodies what many people consider to be old-fashioned American virtues in a virtually pristine state.,Apollo 13
112384,Apollo 13 Ron Howards soaring salute to space exploration lifts off with a payload of the right stuff-courage can-do grace under pressure and other qualities derided as machismo by some and applauded as old-fashioned values by others.,Apollo 13
112384,Major rousing thoroughly professional Hollywood entertainment that will dazzle you with its re-creations of historical events take you inside the space capsule and the Houston command center and leave you wondering where our heroes [have gone].,Apollo 13
112384,For a space movie both the special effects and photography are surprisingly pedestrian. Where it scores is in subtly restating traditional notions of male heroism.,Apollo 13
112384,Playing the tough commanding Jim Lovell is a substantial stretch for Mr. Hanks but as usual his seeming ingenuousness overshadows all else about the role. Theres not a false move to anything he does on screen.,Apollo 13
112384,If you thought Tom Hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star wait until youve seen him eight stories tall.,Apollo 13
112384,The special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original while the Oscar-winning sound and James Horners rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system.,Apollo 13
112384,The re-release of Ron Howards Apollo 13 in the IMAX format proves absolutely that really really really good things can come in enormous packages.,Apollo 13
112384,On a purely pictorial level this is one of the best-looking IMAX movies ever.,Apollo 13
112384,Blowing up some 35mm films to an image 10 times larger could magnify their plot faults and performance shortcomings. But Apollo 13 with its taut cast script and direction profits from the process.,Apollo 13
112384,Its a great American adventure and a wonderful film to bring to IMAX.,Apollo 13
112384,Its easily Howards best film.,Apollo 13
114287,Rob Roy has its diversions but they are unfortunately outweighed by some heavy baggage that contains not enough of substance.,Rob Roy
114287,Neeson makes a less dashing action hero than did Day-Lewis but he brings enough gravitas to his role to endow his love for his wife Mary (Lange) and his conflict with Cunningham with real emotional punch.,Rob Roy
114287,Rob Roy is best watched for local color and for its hearty hot-blooded stars.,Rob Roy
114287,With such a cast and the setting of the Highlands plus a story with a gold mine of dramatic potential it is a puzzle why Rob Roy is so uninvolving.,Rob Roy
114287,You always know where its going even as it meanders for two and a half hours getting there.,Rob Roy
114287,No more than moderately satisfying.,Rob Roy
114287,Director Michael Caton-Jones and Sharp both Scotsmen are so caught up in the legend that they dont seem to notice that RR is about as heroic as a hatful of haggis.,Rob Roy
114287,Strange. I thought I had seen enough sword fights in movies to last a lifetime but I was wrong.,Rob Roy
114287,As embodied by Liam Neeson Rob Roy is a tremendous protagonist -- a naive man whose belief in honor and whose love for a woman family and clan make him a figure to cheer for.,Rob Roy
114287,If youre in a forgiving campy frame of mind (which I must have been the night I saw this) theres cheap pleasure to be gained from the experience.,Rob Roy

430912,Stupefyingly lackluster.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Like many sequels this is actually a remake and it suffers from the law of diminishing returns.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,The plot already mired in nonsensical backstory collapses with the late-inning introduction of a tired metafictional device (not to mention a wildly lunging Usual Suspects twist).,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Basic Instinct 2 has a stylish look and a few sexy moments but the plot goes from confusing to implausible to absolutely ludicrous in the final sequence.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Even the ice pick looks like it really doesnt want to be there.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,The 1992 phenomenon was creepy tense and sexually charged in a bold yet tawdry way. This sequel lacks even a shred of those elements.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,If youre trying to reinvigorate the art of the stylish thriller the movie you come up with needs to be stylish and it needs to be thrilling. Basic Instinct 2 written by Leora Barish and Henry Bean and directed by Michael Caton-Jones is neither.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Despite all the heavy breathing and mood lighting Basic Instinct 2 is so dull that you might find yourself easily distracted by side issues.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,What Basic Instinct 2 is missing besides any of the trashy good fun of the original is a subtitle. Heres a suggestion: A Girls Guide to Dressing for Her Shrink.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,This film is unable to involve entertain or titillate. Basically it stinks.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Stones purring snarling bedroom kink is embarrassing.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,But the movie is a baroque little mystery of so little mystery or consequence that youre literally sitting there waiting for the next full body cavity search.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,At this point there are inflatable toys that are livelier than Stone but how can you tell the difference? Basic Instinct 2 is not an erotic thriller. Its taxidermy.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,As with the first film BI2 abounds with red herrings and misdirection and comes up with an equally ambiguous Did she or didnt she? ending. But there are problems here beyond its staleness.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Few expected Basic Instinct 2 to be very good but no one expected it to be this boring.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,Using the same basic plot as 1992s original BI2 feels less like a sequel than a remake whose shelf life has expired.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,The only real intrigue comes in the films risky flirtation with high camp.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,The original movie lacked sense but it did possess that sizzle. This one has neither.,Basic Instinct 2
430912,In the end this is a movie that makes the original Basic Instinct look good. And in a way thats quite a feat.,Basic Instinct 2
112462,By now Jim Carrey is doing sarcastic takes on his own sarcasm and theres something funny and a little scary in that.,Batman Forever
112462,Joel Schumacher submits to the Wagnerian bombast with an overly busy surface and the script by Lee and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman basically runs through the formula as if its a checklist.,Batman Forever
112462,As for Kilmer he gamely steps into the dual Batman/Wayne role but cant get much traction finding as Michael Keaton had that beyond a stern jaw theres not much to be done with it since the suit does most of the work.,Batman Forever
112462,The second sequel to Tim Burtons 1989 blockbuster makes its predecessors appear models of subtlety and coherence.,Batman Forever
112462,The film recovers from that initial confusion to get stronger as it goes along and to shape up as a free-form playground for its various masquerading stars.,Batman Forever

112495,In attempting to make its politics palatable as entertainment the film has grafted them onto a boatload of Hollywood implausibilities whose excesses cripple believability.,Beyond Rangoon
112495,As an exercise in art or even polemics Beyond Rangoon is beyond redemption but still works its occasional magic with extraordinary flair.,Beyond Rangoon

112495,A rare film one that is intelligent emotional and exciting.,Beyond Rangoon
112495,Because the film is well acted and directed and the Malaysian locations are exotic and seductive I got involved even though the story ... was so clearly concocted.,Beyond Rangoon
112495,An odd movie brilliant in places but frustrating all the same.,Beyond Rangoon
112495,Besides being an intelligent and gripping thriller with a solid grounding in real recent historical events Beyond Rangoon also gives movie-goers a rare opportunity to watch a female hero.,Beyond Rangoon
109370,The best thing you can say about this scattershot political satire is that the late John Candys next-to-last picture is relatively funnier and less depressing than his valedictory Wagons East.,Canadian Bacon
112642,A fairy tale with the soul of a rerun.,Casper
112642,Its not clear why Steven Spielbergs Amblin decided to make a live-action entertainment starring the least interesting and most saccharine of all 50s cartoon characters.,Casper
112642,Once the audience has become inured to the wide-eyed protagonist and impressive digitized effects theres little sense of wonder or awe to be found.,Casper
112642,The set design however merely disguises what is in fact an intimate and likeable picture.,Casper
112642,Caspers movie is not the cleverest one around but its hero may be the most lovable.,Casper
112642,This doesnt usually happen to me but 15 minutes before the end of Casper I suddenly realized that if I didnt take a deep breath I was going to start sobbing.,Casper
112642,As a technical achievement its impressive and entertaining. And there is even a little winsome philosophy.,Casper
112642,As expected it features extra-spectral effects slews of celebrity guest shots and splendidly decorated sets. For all of that though the film is duller than a dead mans eyes.,Casper
112642,Without the talent of Ricci Casper would have been a truly barren motion picture. As it is its still not very good.,Casper
112642,The horror the horror.,Casper
112642,Casper moves like a dirge especially when it sinks into a meditation on death a la Ghost. As specter spectacles go Casper is a bit of a ghost bust.,Casper
112688,There is a force and focus in Lees work an absence of intellectual posturing and a willingness to let his material speak for itself that he has not achieved before.,Clockers
112688,The performances are strong but the spectator often feels adrift in an overly busy intrigue.,Clockers
112688,A study of the urban dope-dealing culture and its toll on everyone who comes in contact with it the picture has an insiders feel that is constantly undercut by the filmmakers impulse to editorialize.,Clockers
112688,The result is a more sober mournful and meditative expressionism than youd expect. Thats not to say the film isnt suspenseful but the directors distaste for the inner citys gun culture is clear to see. Superbly acted.,Clockers
112688,Helping make these points is as strong a cast as Lee has yet worked with.,Clockers
112688,Has the strengths of Spike Lees best work without the preachiness and gimmicky camera moves of his weakest.,Clockers

112688,A real wicked thrill.,Clockers
112688,Clockers uses unexpected narrative turns to accentuate the themes of lost innocence and uncultivated potential and affirms that tragic melodrama is not a prerequisite for emotional impact.,Clockers
112688,Lee captures the despair self-delusion occasional terror and frequent humor of a praised and popular novel aided by the potent acting his direction virtually guarantees.,Clockers
112688,What we get mostly in the film is a sense of Lee flailing struggling to get a handle on his material.,Clockers

112740,The screenplay may be credited to Michael Schiffer but the punchy dialogue has Quentin Tarantino written all over it. The cast has a ball.,Crimson Tide

112740,Crimson Tide is pop-action naval gazing at its finest.,Crimson Tide
112740,This is the rare kind of war movie that not only thrills people while theyre watching it but invites them to leave the theater actually discussing the issues.,Crimson Tide
112740,Because of the contained environment submarines make great settings for thrillers with the throbbing of the engines sounding like a pulse. Crimson Tide is no exception -- the atmosphere alone is sufficient to keep the audience on edge.,Crimson Tide

112851,Rodriguezs second feature may be a rambling derivative exercise in gratuitous violence but its determination to proceed as if the word restraint never existed makes for gleeful entertainment.,Desperado
112851,Mr. Rodriguez may be good enough to make a film about anything but Desperado would collapse if its characters had to do anything but play with guns.,Desperado
112851,What Rodriguez has essentially done in Desperado is make a slicker more expensive copy of what came before. And what looked promising for $7000 looks tiresome for a whole lot more.,Desperado
112851,The routine gets tiresome for the Mariachi and for the audience too after about an hour.,Desperado
112851,Desperado is best when Rodriguez lets his playful side cut through the blare of a born filmmaker indulging his first chance at high-end Hollywood fireworks.,Desperado
112851,On the whole watching the film is about as much fun as sitting on a cactus.,Desperado
112851,What happens looks terrific. Now if [Rodriguez] can harness that technical facility to a screenplay thats more story than setup he might really have something.,Desperado

796302,Although the film is pitched as dark comedy theres nothing very funny about the sexualization of teenagers.,The Babysitters
796302,Id call it a depressing soft-core porn flick but that overstates its titillation factor. Mainly its just icky.,The Babysitters
796302,It reads like a Cinemax special event and as good as Leguizamo and Waterston (daughter of Sam) are the skeevy fantasy-fulfillment plot that drives David Ross movie is uncomfortably risky business.,The Babysitters
796302,The film remains engaging in no small part because of the beguiling and enigmatic performance of [Katherine] Waterston daughter of Law & Order star Sam Waterston.,The Babysitters
796302,Despite the racy content and the alarmist 18A classification The Babysitters is a remarkably restrained and decent film. Its polished smoothly edited and shot with simple elegance.,The Babysitters
796302,The premise is out of 70s porn and so is the overbroad satire and almost total lack of conviction.,The Babysitters
796302,Woefully reductive and painful.,The Babysitters
796302,Like televisions Six Feet Under and the recent film Juno its the perfect antidote to the dopey butter-cream-frosted teen flicks of John Hughes -- Pretty in Pink with poison sauce.,The Babysitters
796302,Ultimately fails to deliver on the audacity of its premise.,The Babysitters

112679,Three female friends grow up in a small town in Ireland in the mid-50s and attend college in Dublin in this nostalgic soap opera thats vaguely evocative of Peyton Place though generally less memorable.,Circle of Friends
112679,Old-fashioned and nostalgic Pat OConnors nicely directed tale of friendship between three Irish girls features a strong central performance from Minnie Driver that promises a bright future in Hollywood pictures.,Circle of Friends
112679,The fizzing dialogue gets all the little details right but the plots nothing new and the lingering shots of hibernian greenery aim straight for mid-Atlantic bland-out.,Circle of Friends
112679,Beyond eliciting warm animated performances from his actors (with a cast that also includes Alan Cumming as a hair-raising suitor of Bennys) Mr. OConnor gives Circle of Friends an enveloping look and sound.,Circle of Friends
112679,Drivers tough core of honesty and wit is bewitching. Sos the movie.,Circle of Friends

112679,Driver is impulsively sweet touching and hilarious as she copes with her new romantic life.,Circle of Friends
112679,Heartwarming and poignant a love story that glows with intelligence and feeling.,Circle of Friends
112679,A lot of films especially love stories seek a level of comfort through predictability but this one goes too far.,Circle of Friends
112679,Like an old-fashioned theater program it tells you early on who and what each of its characters is -- and so they prove to be enjoyably.,Circle of Friends

109445,Clerks is so utterly authentic that its heroes have never heard of their generation.,Clerks
109445,The film looks no more expensive than it was; some of the acting (by local nonprofessionals) is spectacularly amateurish; the story is a series of anecdotes about hockey shopping and loving the one youre with. But its worth loitering in this shop.,Clerks
109445,Amateurishly acted clumsily edited and slapped together out of what looks like surveillance camera footage the thing bumps along not so much on talent as on audacity.,Clerks

109579,Polanski certainly gets the maximum voltage and precision out of his story and actors keeping us preternaturally alert to shifting power relationships and delayed revelations.,Death and the Maiden
109579,Kingsley shrewdly tantalizes the viewer about his identity and gets to deliver the texts most riveting monologue at the end. The lesser-known Wilson may be the first among equals impressing strongly as the equivocating husband.,Death and the Maiden
109579,Polanski wisely never opens out the action from the remote clifftop house. In keeping things claustrophobic close-up and ambivalent he heightens the suspense (not to mention the sexual tension).,Death and the Maiden
109579,Mr. Polanski treads lightly on the clumsier lines and sustains tension by creating an elegant unobtrusive dance with the camera.,Death and the Maiden
109579,Death and the Maiden forces the audience to confront questions about torture and punishment.,Death and the Maiden
109579,Polanski keeps the situation ambiguous to provoke questions of guilt and responsibility.,Death and the Maiden

109686,Dumb and Dumber which features Carrey and Jeff Daniels as nitwits traveling cross-country is a frayed string of gags posing as a movie. Carrey though does literal-minded doofdom with peerless enthusiasm.,Dumb and Dumber
109686,The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that its hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise.,Dumb and Dumber
109686,This is a long way from the social comedy of Jerry Lewis. The characters here are ultimately turned into punching bags or punch-line dispensers.,Dumb and Dumber
109686,Given American cinemas current obsession with innocence and ignorance at least this never romanticises its protagonists. They are genuinely irredeemably 100 per cent no-hopers.,Dumb and Dumber

109686,Inspired irreverent spark-driven comedy that takes you places you never thought a movie would go -- even a Jim Carrey movie.,Dumb and Dumber
109686,Carrey I am now convinced is a true original. In The Mask he had the screenplay and production to back him up. Here the filmmaking is more uncertain.,Dumb and Dumber

109707,Making a movie about the life of Ed Wood certainly qualifies as an impossible dream but Burton has pulled it off with wit imagination and something amazingly close to grace.,Ed Wood

109771,Theres something too artificial and highfalutin about the movie.,Farinelli
109771,A fascinating if occasionally overly melodramatic recreation of a period when Baroque music ruled Europe.,Farinelli
109771,Because Carlo Broschi the 18th-century castrato singer known as Farinelli was himself such an exotic and sensationalistic figure youd think that creating a dull movie out of his flamboyant life would be next to impossible. Think again.,Farinelli
109771,Glossy and histrionic salacious and empty Farinelli reduces a fascinating story to a series of hissy fits and leering glances.,Farinelli
109771,Farinelli one of the 1995 Oscar nominees in the foreign film category is onto an interesting story all right but it leaves us feeling like some of Farinellis lovers that something is missing.,Farinelli

109906,It has both ideas and a point of view. But the ideas are far from new and the point of view is blatantly knee-jerk.,The Glass Shield (The Johnny Johnson Trial)
109906,Though no masterpiece the film is an interesting sidebar for moviegoers who try to keep up; its like a 50s film noir oddity you catch on 3 a.m. TV only to find that its become a more scintillating view than Ben-Hur.,The Glass Shield (The Johnny Johnson Trial)

110216,The plot is a more fertile ground for comedy than the sperm milkshake that made Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito brothers in Reitmans Twins.,Junior

114214,A deadpan black comedy Sam Raimis fast-paced movie looks and sounds like a Leone oater but more so.,The Quick and the Dead
114214,Mr. Raimi is limited by a sketch mentality which means his jokes tend to be over long before his films end. But his tastes for visual mischief and crazy ill-advised homage can still make for sly sporadic fun.,The Quick and the Dead

114214,You get lots of clothes here but no emperor.,The Quick and the Dead
114214,Although Stone may be pleasing to some eyes shes pretty small in the saddle here -- just an innocuous gender twist on the reluctant cowboy hero. And her story of hellbent revenge is about as compelling as a 30-second fragrance commercial.,The Quick and the Dead

110907,The picture is not a social satire. Its a mess.,Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)
110907,Altman and his writer former Chicago Sun-Times reporter Barbara Shulgasser should have gone further and been meaner; too many of his jokes are generic slapstick instead of being aimed squarely at industrys targets.,Ready to Wear (Pret-a-Porter)

110598,Its a bright buoyant comedy about a very sad young woman -- and regrettably the mix just doesnt work.,Muriel's Wedding
110598,Muriels Wedding isnt a perfect comedy tragedy or drama but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look.,Muriel's Wedding

109444,The uneven flow is as likely to lead to a snoozing viewer as to one on the edge of their seat.,Clear and Present Danger
109446,Its a successful frame-turner no more no less and the pleasure we feel is every bit as mild and just as fleeting.,The Client
109446,A high-voltage charge of suspense action and humor.,The Client
109446,It twists and turns in all the expected places and almost never rises above the ordinary.,The Client
109446,Mindless non-taxing fun especially if you havent read the book.,The Client
109446,Not as satisfying as it should be.,The Client
109446,This isnt a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer entertainment.,The Client
109504,Lee is a great self-promoter. After all his press releases and all his interviews we are given films that are sketchy unfelt and distancing -- incidents in Lees career the only drama that really interests him.,Crooklyn
109504,The key problem is that the film is simply a ragged series of anecdotal sketches.,Crooklyn
109504,Its the first Spike Lee film with the potential to be turned into a television show. More important its the first one to display real warmth of heart.,Crooklyn
109504,This remarkable movie will haunt you for a good long time.,Crooklyn
109504,Modulating from heavy to light from angry to lyrical and so on the movies an enjoyable emotional symphony.,Crooklyn
109504,Lee is as talented as any director is capturing an era and some of the early scenes perfectly recall the mood of the time. The pop soundtrack may be a little too obvious but it gets the job done.,Crooklyn
109504,Crooklyn is not in any way an angry film. But thinking about the difference between its world and ours can make you angry and I think that was one of Lees purposes here.,Crooklyn
109506,Alex Proyass pulp revenge fantasy based on a comic-book saga by James OBarr is dark moody and seductively overwrought; its an amazingly pure expression of morbid adolescent romanticism.,The Crow
109506,Its a pleasure to welcome The Crow -- a bird of a very different feather.,The Crow
109506,As exploitation pictures go Ive seen a whole lot worse.,The Crow
109506,The Crow starring the late Brandon Lee is like one long fright night. Even though it was photographed in color the edge-of-darkness atmosphere descends on the audience like a shroud.,The Crow
109506,Whats scary about The Crow is the story and the style itself: American Gothic Poe-haunted nightmare translated to the age of cyberpunk science fiction revenge movies and outlaw rock n roll all set in a hideously decaying crime-ridden urban hell.,The Crow
109506,If The Crow is forgettable entertainment it can stand as an eerie epitaph for an actor who looked like he was on the way to better things.,The Crow
109506,It succeeds in bringing OBarrs comic-book vision to life but theres little else going on behind the graphic razzle-dazzle and the moody ominous soundtrack.,The Crow
109506,A seamless pulsating dazzlingly visual revenge fantasy that stands as one of the most effective live-actioners ever derived from a comic strip.,The Crow
109506,Visually its a treat; characterisation is sharp particularly the nicely defined villains; and the action scenes though soft-pedalled still pack a satisfying crunch.,The Crow
109506,It is a dark lurid revenge fantasy and not the breakthrough star-making movie some people have claimed. But it is a genre film of a high order stylish and smooth.,The Crow
109506,Lee is sensational on all counts in a final performance that brims over with athleticism and ardor.,The Crow
109506,If he had to die so soon this movie is the best and most appropriate sendoff Lee could have hoped for.,The Crow
109506,The Crow allows no room for the viewer to take a breath as it blazes with breakneck speed from scene to scene.,The Crow
109506,It is a stunning work of visual style - the best version of a comic book universe Ive seen - and Brandon Lee clearly demonstrates in it that he might have become an action star had he lived.,The Crow
109450,Cobb cuts right through the winner-take-all ethos of American athletics. Its a raw inspired audaciously funny and unexpectedly moving collaboration between the writer-director Ron Shelton and Tommy Lee Jones.,Cobb
109450,Ty Cobb is such a towering figure in this motion picture that its easy to overlook Al Stump -- and Robert Wuhls feisty witty performance in the thankless role.,Cobb
109450,[Jones] lets it all loose here. Its the performance of a lifetime: full of menace and venom eloquence and fire rot and pathos crackling rawness and realism.,Cobb
109450,The result whether Cobb is wailing about greatness or ruminating about the dark circumstances around his fathers death is a performance too operatic and out of control.,Cobb
109450,This is a messy movie sometimes repetitive sometimes too compressed and allusive. But thats like saying Ty Cobb was not a very good sport -- irrelevant in comparison to the horrific fascination of his story.,Cobb
109450,Its such a potent and courageous wreck of a movie that its worth more than most successes.,Cobb
109450,Its unclear just how much sympathy we are to extend the unrepentant and bullying title character.,Cobb
109450,Sheltons film is about the nature of truth and popular myth about the single-minded pursuit of glory and the horrors within. Its also very funny.,Cobb
109450,Even allowing for the intentional excesses of such an episode delicacy is a casualty here.,Cobb
109450,This histrionic portrait of the most celebrated cur in sports history comes across like a fly ball that thuds on the ground.,Cobb
109450,Sheltons strong stinging film -- one of the years best -- wants to get at something ingrained in the American character: the irrational desire to make saints of sports heroes.,Cobb
109450,Its the kind of film where you admire the craftsmanship and artistry while questioning the wisdom of the project itself.,Cobb
109450,Jones on-target portrayal of the dying athlete is mesmerizing.,Cobb
109450,Of all the good and great movies that have slipped through the cracks in recent years none has been treated as appallingly as Cobb.,Cobb
109450,Cobb turns into a noisy cantankerous buddy picture.,Cobb
109813,While the movie may act like a madeleine for television-obsessed baby-boomers it works even better as a colorful playland that will appeal to small children.,The Flintstones

109813,Its a dull day in Bedrock.,The Flintstones
109813,Maybe its because so many of the things they do in the movie are lifted directly from the show but a lot of stuff seems stale.,The Flintstones

109830,This tall tale may reach monumental proportions but Forrest Gump always keeps its magical airiness and grace.,Forrest Gump
109830,Credit for the success of the film has to start with director Robert Zemeckis who has taken his Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit success and parlayed it into a more mature yet equally entertaining film.,Forrest Gump
109830,Warm wise and wearisome as hell.,Forrest Gump
109830,For all its ambition the movie ends up using great historical events in the service of a dubious sentimentality.,Forrest Gump
109830,A picaresque story of a simpletons charmed odyssey through 30 years of tumultuous American history Forrest Gump is whimsy with a strong cultural spine.,Forrest Gump
109830,Judging by the the movies enduring popularity the message that stupidity is redemption is clearly what a lot of Americans want to hear.,Forrest Gump
109830,As this mawkish conservative movie ultimately goes to prove: ignorance is bliss.,Forrest Gump
109830,Forrest Gump has the elements of an emotionally gripping story. Yet it feels less like a romance than like a coffee-table book celebrating the magic of special effects.,Forrest Gump
109830,Skillfully adapted by screenwriter Eric Roth the story belongs in the company of such sweet classics as Rain Man and Harvey.,Forrest Gump
109830,A movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace.,Forrest Gump
109830,Like the best movie actors Hanks is a superb reactor.,Forrest Gump
109830,This is one summer movie that doesnt evaporate the minute you leave the theater.,Forrest Gump
109830,Hanks is so charming as Gump so heroic in his guilelessness and belief in simple virtues that you want to excuse the films excesses and overlook Zemeckis weakness for easy maudlin sentiment.,Forrest Gump
109830,Passionate and magical Forrest Gump is a tonic for the weary of spirit.,Forrest Gump
109830,Hanks is superb reemploying the childlike presence he brought to Big.,Forrest Gump
109830,What a magical movie.,Forrest Gump
109830,Reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disneys America.,Forrest Gump
109831,The infectious charm and sunny goodwill of Four Weddings and a Funeral can so immediately buoy a soul ravaged by winter weather and winter movies.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,There are movies so breezy even flimsy that you can enjoy them as genial providers of an evenings entertainment yet forget all about them by the time you leave the multiplex.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,A grocery store would sell this on its generic shelf: the brittle upper-class British cleverness is strictly standard issue.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,Truly beguiling romantic comedy is one of the hardest things for a modern film to pull off but a winning British team has done it in Four Weddings and a Funeral.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,A British comedy thats classy and commercial -- and most important very very funny.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,If ever a film resembled a wedding cake it is Four Weddings and a Funeral a multi-tiered confection with a romantic spirit and an enchantingly pretty veneer.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,The players who include Simon Callow Kristin Scott Thomas Rowan Atkinson and Sophie Thompson exude comedic brightness as they go about their gossipy farcical self-deprecating sorry-about-that-old-chap just-being-English business.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,Delightful and sly.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,Some of the funniest scenes bounce off the nightmares of every bride and groom before the wedding.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
109831,The simplest and most honest expression of praise that I can offer Mike Newells latest movie is that it represents two hours of solid movie magic.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
113305,Despite some likable performances (Epps is especially winning) the drama in Higher Learning is constricted hemmed in by Singletons compulsion to view his characters as walking paradigms of racial and sexual politics.,Higher Learning
113305,Higher Learning has a great many things on its mind which immediately places it in a rather exclusive category of American films these days.,Higher Learning
113305,A stylish intelligent film-maker Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college communitys contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism.,Higher Learning
113305,Everyone here from beer-swilling white fraternity boys to rap-loving black students harassed by the campus police can be judged at face value. Everyone is exactly what he or she seems.,Higher Learning
113305,Higher Learning is often cliched unfocused and didactic. But Singleton has a goal most of his contemporaries have given up on: He wants to make a movie that makes a difference.,Higher Learning
113305,Presenting problems is not the same as dramatizing them successfully and as strong as his message is Singleton has not found the best way to deliver it.,Higher Learning
113305,Its not as dispensable as Singletons sophomore effort Poetic Justice but its a long way from the assured freshman storytelling of Boyz N the Hood.,Higher Learning
113305,Despite excesses and missteps there is still a wealth of digestible thought-provoking material in Higher Learning.,Higher Learning
113305,Singleton has made all the right political moves given his complicated circumstances but he hasnt really made a movie of them.,Higher Learning
113305,For every persuasive insight John Singleton brings to Higher Learning his thoughtful but flawed movie about multiculturalism and racism he throws in something equally disappointing.,Higher Learning
113305,Thought-provoking.,Higher Learning
113305,Higher Learning presents a profoundly uninspired and misguided piece that seems prompted by little more than a desire to make a Big Statement.,Higher Learning

107472,Sometimes clunky but consistently fascinating.,"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl"

107472,Overly long but fascinating.,"The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl"
110357,The Lion King complete with jaunty songs by Elton John and Tim Rice is undeniably and fully worthy of its glorious Disney heritage. It is a gorgeous triumph -- one lion in which the studio can take justified pride.,The Lion King
110357,Between traumas the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers (composed by Elton John and Tim Rice) and silly rambunctious comedy.,The Lion King
110357,Its perhaps the closest Disney has come to creating a consciously mythical entertainment in the style of Star Wars. Yet like that film it keeps its sense of humor and fun.,The Lion King
110357,Even with its flaws this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience wants. Too bad flesh and blood films cant be this consistent.,The Lion King
110357,It bears repeating that The Lion King is quite entertaining as childrens fare goes these days. But Disney has established a standard so high on animated features that anything less than a classic leaves you feeling that somethings missing.,The Lion King
110357,The rest of The Lion King alternates between grand-opera melodrama and low-comedy hi-jinks superbly blending the two approaches.,The Lion King
110357,Everyone young and old will find something to appreciate in this Shakespearean tale of a young lion discovering his rightful place in the world.,The Lion King
110357,The story line is a Joseph Campbell hero-quest so stripped down to its basics as to become dull.,The Lion King
110357,A computer-animated scene featuring a stampede of wildebeest is positively breathtaking.,The Lion King
110357,The Lion King more than any of the recent wave of Disney animated features has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie.,The Lion King
110357,The result is a step toward multiculturalism and ecological correctness though not without a certain amount of confusion.,The Lion King
110357,A winner.,The Lion King
110357,A crown jewel of modern Disney animation.,The Lion King

107426,Bertoluccis celebrated burnt-orange-and-burnished-lemon look remains handsome and the story itself still commands some interest as a pivot into daunting material.,Little Buddha
107426,Bertoluccis epic is a disappointment.,Little Buddha
107426,A crazily mesmerizing pop artifact that ranks alongside Herman Hesses novel Siddhartha in terms of extreme earnestness and quasi-religious entertainment value.,Little Buddha
107426,Though uneven the film is engagingly moving and often humorous.,Little Buddha
107426,Little Buddha succeeds precisely because of its guileless innocence.,Little Buddha
107426,The modern sequences lack realism or credibility. The ancient sequences play like the equivalent of a devout Bible story.,Little Buddha
107426,As beautifully photographed and intelligently-written as the movie is it has no emotional depth or appeal and is often as cold and clinical as its gray depiction of Seattle.,Little Buddha

110475,When his face turns green and his limbs get limber Carreys pretty much unstoppable. This cartoon-y creation is an amazing fusion of physical comedy and state-of-the- art cinema illusion.,The Mask
110475,The gangland plot is flimsy (bad guy Peter Greene wears too much eyeliner) and the jokes are erratic but its a far better showcase for Carreys comic-from-Uranus talent than Ace Ventura.,The Mask
110475,Carrey and his aggressive overbite are back but this time hes better used as an ingredient instead of as the plot.,The Mask
110475,If a movie star was born in Ace Ventura he is christened in The Mask. Quite simply this is the best and freest crazy comedy to come along since Beetlejuice.,The Mask
110475,Not only is he adept at physical humor the kind of knockabout stuff that recalls the classic silent clowns but Carrey also has a bright and likable screen presence a lost puppy quality that is surprisingly endearing.,The Mask
110475,Carrey now has the clout to find a vehicle worthy of his hyperactive gooniness. When he does well see if hes truly a jester for our time or simply the moron of the moment.,The Mask
110475,Adroitly directed viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun.,The Mask
110475,The results are easy to watch though awfully familiar and simpleminded.,The Mask
110475,The design is bright as a button and the transformation scenes real eye-poppers but the films best special effect is putty-faced Carrey with his razzle-dazzle star turn as the affable Stanley and his manic alter ego.,The Mask
110475,Bright-eyed crazily intense irrepressibly silly Mr. Carrey can be funny without fireworks. He deserves material clever enough to let him do just that.,The Mask
110475,Carrey is the ultimate party dude and like the masked man says this party is smokin.,The Mask
110475,Even without the state-of-the-art boundary-busting computerized effects from Industrial Light & Magic Carreys a human cartoon and his spontaneous Avery-esque anything-for-a-laugh outrageousness makes this otherwise blank Mask a must-see.,The Mask
110475,As a comedy The Mask is genial but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof.,The Mask
110475,The Mask is a perfect vehicle for the talents of Jim Carrey who underwhelmed me with Ace Ventura Pet Detective but here seems to have found a story and character that work together with manic energy.,The Mask
110475,Doesnt have any more material than a Tex Avery cartoon.,The Mask
110478,There can be little doubt that a whole new generation is about to discover the charm wit and fun of Maverick.,Maverick
110478,A financially successful exercise in target-marketing but not much of a movie.,Maverick
110478,At almost every turn Maverick adds sly comic episodes.,Maverick
110478,The first lighthearted laugh-oriented family Western in a long time and one of the nice things about it is it doesnt feel the need to justify its existence. It acts like its the most natural thing in the world to be a Western.,Maverick
110478,Affectionate amiable eager-to-please in a TV-movieish sort of way.,Maverick
110478,Maverick may be as close as anything comes to a perfect summer movie (as opposed to a perfect movie).,Maverick
110588,A highly absorbing but naggingly patchy look at the acerbic writer Dorothy Parker and her cohorts at the legendary Algonquin Round Table.,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Mrs. Parker and the Round Table)
110588,Absolutely superb.,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Mrs. Parker and the Round Table)
110588,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle has its flaws but it also has a heartfelt grasp of what set Dorothy Parker apart from her fellow revelers and makes her so emblematic a figure even today.,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Mrs. Parker and the Round Table)
110588,The Dorothy Parker that Leigh and Rudolph present isnt one-dimensional. In addition to being savagely funny she is also capable of great elegance and genuine insight.,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Mrs. Parker and the Round Table)
110588,What a wonderful detailed portrait. And what an evocation of a time and a mood. Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle is truly one of those films that inhabits its own world.,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Mrs. Parker and the Round Table)

110950,Ryder and Hawke bring crucial authenticity to their roles with effortless appeal. Youll find yourself wanting more of these characters than the movie gives you.,Reality Bites
110950,However conventional Reality Bites resolves to be it is always engaging. Best of all Ryder has her greatest role since Heathers once again proving herself a seriously funny young actress.,Reality Bites
110950,Its a good example of an anti-establishment comedy crippled by a seeming desire to infatuate the establishment itself. What Reality Bites needs most is a good bite. From reality.,Reality Bites
110950,Among the movies strengths are the performances especially that of Ryder who comes across as bright beautiful and more delicate than ever before.,Reality Bites
110950,When the movie is over you dont feel as if you had shared the experience of a new generation; you feel puzzled and vaguely crummy as if you had just read a solemn news-magazine cover story about it.,Reality Bites
110950,Yearning hilarious lost within their precocious self-awareness these slackers have soul.,Reality Bites
110950,Although it never became the definitive document of Generation X Reality Bites is a touchstone for anyone just out of college and stuck with more ideals than job prospects not to mention a head full of bad-TV trivia.,Reality Bites
110950,In 1994 the novelty of seeing a romantic comedy written and directed by as well as starring people in their early 20s made for a certain freshness but after a point this youthfulness consists of little more than TV references.,Reality Bites
110950,Reality Bites begins as a promising and eccentric tale of contemporary youth but evolves into a banal love story as predictable as any lush Hollywood affair.,Reality Bites
110950,Theres probably a moderate little romantic comedy crying to get out here but the films vain striving for casual hip proves suffocatingly obtrusive.,Reality Bites
110950,Like the generation it presents so appealingly it doesnt see any point in getting all bent out of shape and overambitious. But it knows how to hang out and have a great time.,Reality Bites
110950,What unwritten law prevented the makers of Reality Bites from observing that their heroine cant shoot video worth a damn that their hero is a jerk and that their villain is the most interesting person in the movie?,Reality Bites

109305,Not even an unsentimental basketball fan like director William Friedkin can wash away all the corn syrup.,Blue Chips
109305,This hard-hitting college basketball drama marks a notable return to form for William Friedkin.,Blue Chips
109305,If Mr. Friedkin didnt have to work so strenuously framing two-shots of Mr. Nolte with this seven-foot athlete it might be hard to remember that Mr. ONeal has a day job.,Blue Chips
109305,The filmmakers dont get the ball into the Shaq-mans hands enough -- both literally and figuratively -- to make this personable giants screen debut memorable.,Blue Chips
109305,If it wasnt for some exciting roundball action Shaquille ONeals hulking-dunking presence and a wonderfully guttural performance from coach Nick Nolte youd slither off the bench asleep.,Blue Chips
109305,A rare example of an entry into this genre that attempts to be honest and unique.,Blue Chips
109305,What Friedkin brings to the story is a tone that feels completely accurate; the movie is a morality play told in the realistic sometimes cynical terms of modern high-pressure college sports.,Blue Chips
49366,Few modern-day movies are more genuinely frightening.,Invasion of the Body Snatchers
49366,This tense offbeat piece of science-fiction is occasionally difficult to follow due to the strangeness of its scientific premise. Action nevertheless is increasingly exciting.,Invasion of the Body Snatchers
49366,Don Siegels superb little effort with its matter-of-fact isolation of hero Kevin McCarthy (ironic no?) from the smarmy complacency of a small town gone to hell -- and way beyond -- points the way to his gripping action films of the 60s and 70s.,Invasion of the Body Snatchers
49366,Its still a chilling picture gaining over Phil Kaufmans smart remake by virtue of its intimate small town setting and it has one of the greatest endings ever filmed.,Invasion of the Body Snatchers
106471,Its probably just as well that last-minute dropouts Kim Basinger or Madonna didnt take the title role as the presence of a star lurking powerlessly on the little platform no doubt would have been distracting and more laughable than it [is] now.,Boxing Helena
106471,Grotesquely misconceived.,Boxing Helena

106471,What Lynch who wrote the script at 19 sees as high drama is really high camp.,Boxing Helena
106471,What Ms. Lynch has given us is a prettied-up snuff movie.,Boxing Helena
106471,Fenns slow-motion fountain-bathing scene looks like an over-the-top TV commercial the cop-out finale is a film-school cliche and the male characters are so one-dimensional and pathetic that the movie could inspire a Mens Action Coalition.,Boxing Helena
106471,Helena might have been salvageable as a so-bad-its-good camp goof -- if only it werent so boring.,Boxing Helena
106471,Its just not a particularly good motion picture.,Boxing Helena

106582,The cinematography and gravity-defying stunt performances are exhilarating. The story alas is pure routine.,Cliffhanger
106582,Some movies get you so excited - so revved up on action and thrills -- that you almost feel like youre flying. Cliffhanger makes you feel like youre dropping.,Cliffhanger
106582,That rasping tension is soon smoothed away as the plot sets off on its daft and hackneyed course.,Cliffhanger
106582,Cliffhanger no doubt makes for a great coming attraction but as a two-hour movie its claims are much more problematic.,Cliffhanger
106582,Take away the mountains and what you have is a howlingly bad action film with a cornball villain out to steal a massive amount of United States currency from federal agents.,Cliffhanger

106582,We are not at Cliffhanger for realism; were there for the cliffhanging and theres plenty of it.,Cliffhanger

106582,Fun for the undemanding but Stallones comeback should have been much tighter.,Cliffhanger
106582,Cliffhanger the new high-altitude thriller starring Sylvester Stallone wastes no time in establishing its first priority that of sending its audience into a cold sweat.,Cliffhanger
106582,Cliffhanger is a device to entertain us and it works especially during those moments when Stallone is hanging by his fingernails over a three-mile fall and the bad guys are stomping on him.,Cliffhanger
106582,A predictably thick-headed occasionally plodding bacchanalia of blood grunts and testosterone.,Cliffhanger
106582,Whether Cliffhanger will bring Stallones name back into the top echelon of action movie stars has yet to be determined but if this film cant the task may be impossible.,Cliffhanger

109456,Mundane sex scenes a standard L.A. car chase and Bakulas outrageously gory death scene (which plays like an unintentional parody) are all part of the predictable script.,Color of Night
109456,The plot gets so convoluted and farfetched that you still may be scratching your head after the denouement but you probably wont be bored.,Color of Night
109456,Its a psycho-erotic thriller with more twists and shocks than the rattlesnake which at one point leaps out at star Bruce Willis-from a location we wont describe. (It would spoil one of the several dozen surprises.),Color of Night
109456,Color of Night and North represent the nadir of Willis plummeting film career. He can be a most engaging talent; his script selection of late has been awful.,Color of Night

109480,In Cops and Robbersons Chevy Chase has an unfortunate chance to prove that theres something even more unfunny than his disastrous talk show.,Cops And Robbersons

106673,A genial expertly played political comedy proves that the spirit of Mr. Smith still lives.,Dave
106673,Its impossible to say whether Dave will play as wonderfully over the decades as it does right now but this smooth-as-silk comedy could not be more timely or connect more hopefully with our current national consciousness.,Dave
106673,While its sloppy and draggy in parts Kevin Kline in the title role delivers an ingratiating comedic performance.,Dave
106673,Kline is so polished and resourceful that he can glide his way through even the creakiest bits and make them seem fresh.,Dave
106673,Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors most especially star Kevin Kline.,Dave
106673,After the promisingly nasty beginning the filmmakers settle into a sort of campaign mode lulling and flattering the audience with a fairy-tale vision of the common mans victory over the Washington establishment.,Dave
106673,Dave has been directed by Ivan Reitman in a refreshingly restrained fashion -- there are plenty of quiet passages rare for American movies these days -- which compliments Kevin Klines wonderful work as well.,Dave
106673,Its a beautifully proportioned wonderfully complete movie.,Dave
106673,For all its modest charm Dave is a true throwback to the Capra days a political comedy just cockeyed enough to triumph over cynicism.,Dave
106673,An overall mood of sweetness may help one to forgive the archaic and childish aspects of the would-be analysis which splits everyone between angels and devils.,Dave
106673,A buoyant comedy in the Capra tradition.,Dave
106673,In spite of this sogginess and despite a self-congratulatory do-gooder streak that the film discovers within Dave this comedy remains bright and buoyant much of the way through.,Dave
106673,[Mixes] comedy and corn with surprising savvy.,Dave
106673,A delightful buoyant new take on an old theme.,Dave

106677,This is light entertainment -- nothing groundbreaking or even especially noteworthy.,Dazed and Confused
106677,The films real inspiration I think is to depict some high school kids from the 1970s with such unblinking attention that we will realize how romanticized most movie teenagers are.,Dazed and Confused
106677,Once every decade or so a movie captures the hormone-drenched fashion- crazed pop-song-driven rituals of American youth culture with such loving authenticity that it comes to seem a kind of anthem.,Dazed and Confused
106697,Ultimately the scripts often sharp social satire is drowned out by the noise and confusion. It is also undercut by casting virtually all the psychopathically murderous criminals as minority-group members.,Demolition Man
106697,Nearly all the SF premises are accorded the status of Andrew Dice Clay one-liners -- which means that they along with the characters keep changing from one scene to the next.,Demolition Man
106697,A noisy soulless self-conscious pastiche that mixes elements of sci-fi action-adventure and romance then pours on a layer of comedy replete with Hollywood in-jokes.,Demolition Man
106697,Forget your preconceptions but not your brain cells and sense of irony.,Demolition Man
106697,Demolition Man is a significant artifact of our time or at least of this week.,Demolition Man
106697,Demolition Man is sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless. It feels computer engineered untouched by human hands. A real pod movie.,Demolition Man
106697,In the end thats all this film is: flames flying bullets and special effects. It could be worse I suppose but as long as people go into this film with their eyes open there shouldnt be any surprises.,Demolition Man
106697,Basically Demolition Man is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre.,Demolition Man

109729,Pretty hard to sit through because Browns incessant beach boy prattle is endlessly irritating.,The Endless Summer 2 - The Journey Continues
109729,Although the movie runs 95 minutes it contains nothing much in the way of information about surfing.,The Endless Summer 2 - The Journey Continues

106873,The filmmakers have provided critics ample artillery by prominently featuring a skunk in this thuddingly flat spoof of erotic thrillers.,Fatal Instinct
106873,Its a real pity because Reiner has certainly been funnier and more inventive on other outings and Sherilyn Fenn makes a winsome gal Friday.,Fatal Instinct
106873,A collection of gags that vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit.,Fatal Instinct
106873,Small jokes are buried under elaborate setups. Sight gags are repeated to the point of exhaustion.,Fatal Instinct
106873,Maybe youll be in the right mood and like this stuff. It looks good and the actors are several notches above the usual parody cast in ability. And yet...,Fatal Instinct
106873,Lacking in both inspiration and ingenuity it doesnt so much spoof the conventions of the genre as dumb down famous -- and in some cases forgotten -- scenes from a slew of other movies.,Fatal Instinct

106332,Like Cheungs ethereally plaintive voice the movie is a siren song thats appealing at first but held too long. It becomes an increasing whine.,Ba wang bie ji (Farewell My Concubine)

106880,While individual interviews pop-video parodies and album titles hit the mark the film as a whole is insufficiently clear-cut in its satire of the bands dubious antics and attitudes.,Fear of a Black Hat
106880,If Mr. Cundieff doesnt match the satirical genius of Mr. Reiners film he does understand the rules of the game.,Fear of a Black Hat
106880,Not as fearless and sharp-edged as it could be -- but it provides a lot of laughs and barbecues a few sacred cows.,Fear of a Black Hat
106880,This movie is not tightly-scripted or elegantly produced but it is (for the most part) highly entertaining. For those who have been waiting for a sequel to Spinal Tap this may be the best alternative.,Fear of a Black Hat
106880,As it recounts the history of N.W.H. the film also manages to lampoon rap music and its archetypes as well as poking fun at the venal self-serving music-business types looking to grab easy money from the scene.,Fear of a Black Hat

106918,Tom Cruise heads a tony cast in a best-seller movie that is firm at the start and infirm by the end.,The Firm
106918,The Firm amusingly satirizes the New Traditionalist aspirations of todays young urban elite -- not so much the lifestyle itself as the illusion of utter security it represents.,The Firm
106918,A smooth adaptation of John Grishams giant bestseller that is destined to be one of the summers strong audience pleasers.,The Firm
106918,Adorning the film in supporting roles are its saving graces.,The Firm
106918,The movie is extremely long (two hours and 34 minutes) and so slow that by the end you feel as if youve been standing up even if youve been sitting down.,The Firm
106918,The book moved at turbo speed. At two and a half hours the movie crawls.,The Firm
106918,With a screenplay that developed the story more clearly this might have been a superior movie instead of just a good one with some fine performances.,The Firm
106918,Pollack makes a solid job of it as does Cruise. But solid isnt enough when it comes to thrillers -- or courtroom dramas for that matter. Solid is great when it comes to office furniture.,The Firm
106918,Cruise was born to play company man and the role is an opportunity to sum up his old roles and transcend them with his most potently emotional work.,The Firm
106918,Very little of what made the written version so enjoyable has been successfully translated to the screen and what were left with instead is an overly-long (two hours and thirty-four minutes to be exact) pedantic thriller.,The Firm
106977,The film is little more than a well-oiled machine that serves a strictly limited function but like a precision timepiece it is a thing to marvel at even under close scrutiny.,The Fugitive
106977,For dynamite suspense loaded with thrills and wicked fun you cant beat The Fugitive.,The Fugitive
106977,Ive already seen The Fugitive twice. Ill probably see it again.,The Fugitive
106977,Thoroughly engaging edge-of-the-seat entertainment.,The Fugitive
106977,While there are actors in this film there isnt much room for acting. The rapid editing and near-absence of dialogue reduces the actors to action figures with colorful labels pasted on their foreheads.,The Fugitive
106977,The Fugitive is a super-adrenalized stemwinder a crisp and jolting melodrama that screws the tension so pitilessly tight it does everything but squeak.,The Fugitive
106977,Its a pleasure to find a thriller fulfilling its duties with such gusto: the emotions ring solid the script finds time to relax into backchat and for once the stunts look like acts of desperation rather than shows of prowess.,The Fugitive
106977,It isnt just a high-powered summer blockbuster. Its something cannier (and rarer): a suspense thriller rooted in character.,The Fugitive
106977,A first-rate thriller.,The Fugitive
106977,A consummate nail-biter that never lags it leaves you breathless from the chase yet anxious for the next bit of mayhem or clever plot twist.,The Fugitive
106977,Though its a good half hour too long this overblown 1993 spin-off of the 60s TV show otherwise adds up to a pretty good suspense thriller.,The Fugitive
106977,A glossy formula chase movie with the requisite number of extravagant action sequences (most notably a massive train crash).,The Fugitive
106977,Both stars have toughness and restraint that make their characters battle of wits truly hypnotic and in many ways more credible than it was on television.,The Fugitive
106977,A juggernaut of exaggeration momentum and thrills.,The Fugitive
106977,Innovative is not a legitimate description of The Fugitive but entertaining is.,The Fugitive
106977,Davis paints with bold visual strokes so that the movie rises above its action-film origins and becomes operatic.,The Fugitive
106977,A flurry of stunts close shaves and deeds of desperate daring it easily transcends its television origins to become a stylish pacemaker-buster on the order of Die Hard MD.,The Fugitive

971209,Writer-director David Twohy (Pitch Black) serves up mechanical thrills culminating in a bogus twist ending,A Perfect Getaway
971209,A Perfect Getaway is a little better -- well a little stranger -- than most of the disposables this summer.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,David Twohys taut palm-sweating thriller has two things going for it: it keeps you guessing and it doesnt insult your intelligence.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,The aesthetic is closer to a grand finale of Survivor than anything else and while all the actors do scrappy work they dont have much psychology to play with -- unlike a fun class-conscious wilderness tale like The Edge.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,I just dont think there was enough drama in the first two-thirds of this movie.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,A terrific twist but goes wasted in a movie that really runs out of steam.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,A Perfect Getaway is the rarest of film treats -- a B-movie that knows where its going and how to get there.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,Twohy serves up a hard-to-swallow second-act twist and an unconvincing back story but the slightly overlong A Perfect Getaway recovers with a pulse-pounding climax.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,The result isnt deadly dull but it does turn what should have been a most dangerous game into a basic scenery-chewing contest.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,A Perfect Getaway is one of those very clever whodunits that keeps you guessing for quite awhile. But on the way home as you replay its tricks you may feel more conned than charmed.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,Twohy correctly banks on the fact that his audience will be too busy sifting through those aforementioned red snappers to care about the details.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,For a low-brow psycho-on-the-loose-in-paradise thriller A Perfect Getaway is surprisingly entertaining with exactly the right elements to overcome the inevitable cliches.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,A gimmicky tricked-out tale that is all too self-aware. But the film does keep you guessing and probably guessing wrong.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,Viewers know the gotcha is coming not only because theyve been groomed to expect a third-act left turn in movies like this but because the films characters wont stop talking about it.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,A Perfect Getaway is a clever heart-pounding thriller and a welcome return to form for the director.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,What is surprising about this effective little thriller is how cleverly writer-director David Twohy toys with the conventions of the genre as they exist today.,A Perfect Getaway
971209,David Twohy doesnt do much new and the twist is as obvious as a tornado in the Texas Panhandle. But that doesnt make it any less of an escapist joyride on a hot summer day.,A Perfect Getaway
109891,The new summer movies dont get much more formulaic than this bald attempt to capture the audience that cant wait to see the next three or four installments of Home Alone.,Getting Even With Dad
109891,This seems to be the work not of screenwriters but of Hollywood marketing executives who believe movies are popular because they tell audiences what they want to hear.,Getting Even With Dad

109891,Here is a movie with broad ambitions: It wants to be a caper a comedy a romance and a showcase for MacAulay Culkin. Thats too much of a stretch.,Getting Even With Dad

107315,Something alarming has happened to Almodovar: He has become commonplace and predictable.,Kika

112651,Its interesting to see how gay and lesbian themes began to be treated openly in films but its fascinating to see how -- earlier -- those themes were used subtextually in films that make no overt reference to the real subject.,The Celluloid Closet
112651,Even if The Celluloid Closet ... isnt quite the most perfectly political piece of filmmaking that youd expect (or hoped) it would be its still a pretty convincing argument and whats more likably entertaining.,The Celluloid Closet

112572,The problem with The Brady Bunch is that satirical or serious ninety minutes is too much.,The Brady Bunch Movie

99653,The movies slogan is Believe not an unreasonable request. But even those whod be happy to comply must get past Ghosts one casting jaw-dropper a certain woolly-mindedness to its script and a production prettified to the point of stickiness.,Ghost

99653,The passion and poignancy of trying to communicate with the dead is well-exploited here. Moore has never been more fetching.,Ghost

99653,A bad movie that a lot of people will like.,Ghost

99653,A comedy romance and supernatural thriller rolled into one Ghost is a zippy pastiche that somehow manages to seem fresh even though its built entirely out of borrowed parts.,Ghost
99653,The real credit for turning a minor mystic romance into one of the most enjoyable movies of the year rests on an excellent script by Bruce Joel Rubin and on the surprisingly sure direction of Jerry Zucker.,Ghost
99653,Ghost is too slow moving at times and a few of its special effects look incongruously silly particularly those showing what happens to ghosts not as virtuous as Sam.,Ghost
99653,Zucker dutifully pushes all the buttons -- romance thrills laughs tears -- that have been pushed before by more assured hands.,Ghost
99653,Surprisingly entertaining.,Ghost
99653,The actors succeed quite nicely in unifying the movies multiple personalities its ricocheting screenplay.,Ghost
99653,Contains some nice ideas and occasionally for whole moments at a time succeeds in evoking the mysteries that it toys with.,Ghost

103064,The picture is full of spectacular action sequences and dazzling special effects but the narrative doesnt have the snap of the originals: its lumbering and monotonous and it carries a heavy-handed anti-nuke message.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Inside Terminator 2 beats a human heart. But its soul is that of a killer machine.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Schwarzenegger is in impeccable deadpan form milking his tough-guy image for all its worth and getting laughs out of the Terminators wooden parroting of slang (No problemo probably will be a catch-phrase to reckon with this summer).,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Terminator 2 is a state-of-the-art action movie all right: It gets you thinking that the most reasonable thing might just have been to blow everyone away.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,A humongous visionary parable that intermittently enthralls and ultimately disappoints. T2 is half of a terrific movie -- the wrong half.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,For all its state-of-the-art pyrotechnics and breathtaking thrills this bruisingly exciting movie never loses sight of its humanity. Thats its point and its pride.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Arnold Schwarzenegger is more comfortable and assured here than the first time around reprising a role so perfectly suited to the voice and physique that have established him as a larger-than-life film persona.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,As a fancy mechanism fueled by the pleasure of watching legions of people and equipment being summarily destroyed this is pretty hot stuff.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day

103064,Mr. Cameron has made a swift exciting special-effects epic that thoroughly justifies its vast expense and greatly improves upon the first films potent but rudimentary visual style.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Its Camerons show; hes the reigning king of movie pow with dark wit and a poets eye for mayhem. T2 cost a reported $100 million and you can actually see where the money went.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Its a tank of a movie big powerful and hard to resist.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day
103064,Nobody I think will complain that it doesnt have enough action.,Terminator 2: Judgment Day

102926,Hopkins cumulative screen image is one of civility and decency and the association adds to the withering macabre effect of his murderer. It is a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy.,The Silence of the Lambs
102926,Demme comes at Harris material from another angle: His movie may deal with madness but his perspective is mercifully sane.,The Silence of the Lambs
102926,Its a gnarled brutal highly manipulative film that at its center seems morally indefensible.,The Silence of the Lambs
102926,Jonathan Demmes thriller is artful pulp -- tabloid material treated with intelligence and care and a weird kind of sensitivity.,The Silence of the Lambs

102926,A smart restrained entertainment it doesnt splash around in blood and hysteria.,The Silence of the Lambs
102926,Adroitly directed by Jonathan Demme it lurks about the exquisite edge of horror before finally leaping into an unholy maw of bloody bones and self-awareness.,The Silence of the Lambs

95159,Perhaps the most unusual aspect of what is surely the years most original and daring comedy is that John Cleese is not the funniest performer in it. Believe it or not that honor goes to none other than the usually somber Kevin Kline.,A Fish Called Wanda

46912,Dial M is less a filmed play than a highly cinematic investigation of theatricality.,Dial M for Murder
46912,Dial M remains more of a filmed play than a motion picture unfortunately revealed as a conversation piece about murder which talks up much more suspense than it actually delivers.,Dial M for Murder

105236,Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs has made a nihilist comedy about how human nature will always undercut the best-laid plans.,Reservoir Dogs
105236,Undeniably impressive pic grabs the viewer by the lapels and shakes hard but it also is about nothing other than a bunch of macho guys and how big their guns are.,Reservoir Dogs
105236,Its unclear whether this macho thriller does anything to improve the state of the world or our understanding of it but it certainly sets off enough rockets to hold and shake us for every one of its 99 minutes.,Reservoir Dogs

105236,Those who survive it emerge in a shell-shocked euphoria -- so good and so blunt is the writing.,Reservoir Dogs
105236,The movie feels like its going to be terrific but Tarantinos script doesnt have much curiosity about these guys.,Reservoir Dogs
105236,Its extremely well-acted written with flair and directed by a 29-year-old first-timer Quentin Tarantino who always knows where to put the camera when to cut to a flashback and how to draw the best work from his brilliant cast.,Reservoir Dogs
105236,The writing is crisp and clean providing line after line of snappy dialogue designed to leave the viewer alternately pondering and laughing aloud.,Reservoir Dogs
105236,A nod to such noir crime classics as Stanley Kubricks The Killing the movies more than savvy sensationalism. Suspense horror and humor are expertly interwoven.,Reservoir Dogs

91763,I know that Platoon is being acclaimed for its realism and I expect to be chastened for being a woman finding fault with a war film. But Ive probably seen as much combat as most of the men saying This is how war is.,Platoon
91763,The movie is beautifully written (by Stone) constructed with strong clean lines immaculately paced and regularly surprising.,Platoon
91763,A film that says...that before you can make any vast sweeping statements about Vietnam you have to begin by understanding the bottom line which is that a lot of people went over there and got killed dead and that is what the war meant for them.,Platoon
91763,Platoon is like the Wall -- a dark and unforgettable memorial to the dead of Vietnam and an awesome requiem to the eternity of war.,Platoon
91763,...its still the standard against which all other movies about the Vietnam War are judged.,Platoon

88846,Very hard to follow.,Brazil
88846,Everything that Terry Gilliam does seems to come in a peak. His movies tend to be a series of exhilarating madding high points and his method of dazzle can be exhausting and exasperating. But you never want him to stop.,Brazil
90605,[Aliens] is a spectacular example of state-of-the-art science fiction simply because it never tries to be overtly spectacular.,Aliens
90605,Its blaster action not Gothic future-horror. Fortunately director-screenwriter James Cameron has shaped his film around the defiant intelligence and sensual athleticism of Weaver and thats where Aliens works best.,Aliens
90605,The idea behind Aliens remains the scariest dirtiest most perversely funny one for a monster film and the Rambo action further gooses us.,Aliens

90605,One sequel that surpasses the original.,Aliens
90605,There is always an interesting tension in Camerons work between masculine and feminine qualities. When it finally hits the fan here were in for the mother of all battles.,Aliens
90605,A flaming flashing crashing crackling blow-em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics.,Aliens
90605,Makes up for lack of surprise with sheer volume of thrills and chills.,Aliens
90605,When it comes to the logical marriage of action adventure and science fiction few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens.,Aliens
90605,The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have and for once the ads dont lie.,Aliens

60196,All three arrive at the cache at the same time. Who gets it? Director Leone doesnt seem to care very much and after 161 minutes of mayhem audiences arent likely to either.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo.)"
60196,The third in the Clint Eastwood series of Italo westerns The Good the Bad and the Ugly is exactly that -- a curious amalgam of the visually striking the dramatically feeble and the offensively sadistic.,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo.)"

78748,The most startling thing watching Alien again is its pacing. For the first 45 minutes little happens. Its all slow exquisite build-up which makes the second half seem all the more horrific.,Alien
78748,It is depressing to watch an expensive crafty movie that never soars beyond its cold desire to score the big bucks.,Alien
78748,The limited strengths of its staple sci-fi horrors always derived from either the offhand organic/ Freudian resonances of its design or the purely (brilliantly) manipulative editing and pacing of its above-average shock quota.,Alien

89881,Ultimately it is this mixture of the grand gesture and the fine touch the big world and the small people who occupy it that lingers with us long after Ran is over.,Ran
89881,By the time Kurosawas camera comes to rest on the films final poignant image a painting of the Buddha that one character had promised another would protect him from harm the movie seemingly has accomplished the impossible: one-upping Shakespeare.,Ran
89881,Theres probably more carnage in Ran than there is in Rambo and The Terminator combined but the new film substitutes intelligence and emotion for mindlessness and emotionalism. You leave the theater awestruck not dumbstruck.,Ran

89881,Those who were suspicious of the filmmakers unambiguous plotting and Westernized approach had to admit to its daunting grandeur.,Ran
89881,Like all of Kurosawas work the human pulse is what drives the drama. Only this time its also the drumbeat of an elegy.,Ran

89881,The shift and sway of a nation divided is vast the chaos terrible the battle scenes the most ghastly ever filmed and the outcome is even bleaker than Shakespeares.,Ran
89881,Kurosawa dares to edit Shakespeares story lines adding back stories and deleting major characters but the motivations and emotions remain true.,Ran
89881,A film of the sort of grandeur that brings to mind Griffiths Birth of a Nation Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance and Eisensteins Ivan the Terrible.,Ran
89881,List any element -- from concept through cinematography battle action editing acting sound music costumes or whatever right down to makeup -- and Kurosawas commitment is total.,Ran
89881,It has become a cliche to call Kurosawa the worlds greatest living filmmaker.,Ran
89881,Nobody can film an epic battle scene like Kurosawa.,Ran
97202,A lot of claims have been made for this campy bloodbath concerto by Hong Kong director John Woo and I must admit that hes even better than Brian De Palma at delivering emotional and visceral excess with staccato relentlessness.,The Killer (Dip huet seung hung)

54215,It blazed a bloody trail for the much-loved slasher cycle but it also assured us that a B-movie could be A-grade in quality and innovation.,Psycho

54215,An unusual good entertainment indelibly Hitchcock and on the right kind of boxoffice beam.,Psycho
54215,Alfred Hitchcocks 1960 masterpiece blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made.,Psycho
54215,All those who still get a chill every time they step into a hotel shower say aye. That you see is the power of Psycho.,Psycho
54215,What makes Psycho immortal when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theater is that it connects directly with our fears.,Psycho
54215,[Hitchcock] has very shrewdly interwoven crime sex and suspense blended the real and the unreal in fascinating proportions and punctuated his film with several quick grisly and unnerving surprises.,Psycho
54215,With the exception of Halloween no latter-day horror/thriller has been capable of generating as many goosebumps.,Psycho
54215,[Hitchcocks] denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair.,Psycho

80455,A demolition symphony that works with the cold efficiency of a Moog synthesizer gone sadistic.,The Blues Brothers
80455,Given all the chaos director and with Aykroyd cowriter John Landis manages to keep things reasonably controlled and in a straight line.,The Blues Brothers
80455,The humor is predicated on underplaying in overscaled situations which is sporadically funny in a Keaton-esque way but soon sputters out through sheer uninspired repetition.,The Blues Brothers
80455,Theres even room in the midst of the carnage and mayhem for a surprising amount of grace humor and whimsy.,The Blues Brothers
80455,This essentially modest movie is reported to have cost about $30 million and what did all that money buy? Scores of car crashes. Too many extras. Overstaged dance numbers. And a hollowness that certainly didnt come cheap.,The Blues Brothers

71562,The stunning text of The Godfather is replaced in Part II with prologues epilogues footnotes and good intentions.,"The Godfather, Part II"
71562,Its a second movie made largely out of the bits and pieces of Mr. Puzos novel that didnt fit into the first. Its a Frankensteins monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own.,"The Godfather, Part II"
71562,Few sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and detail of this one.,"The Godfather, Part II"
93058,If his considerable achievement in this long- awaited film falls short of his Olympian standards there is a reason that ought to give Kubrick some satisfaction. The world has caught up with Kubrick and what he has to say.,Full Metal Jacket
93058,It may seem too spare too clinical its moments of war even too familiar for some. But aiming for minds as well as hearts Kubrick hits his target squarely.,Full Metal Jacket

93058,Its a great piece of filmmaking diminished only by a second act that fails to live up to the first act of the Marines in training.,Full Metal Jacket
93058,Full Metal Jacket is not a realistic film -- it is horror-comic superrealism from a Gods-eye view -- but it should fully engage the ordinary movie grunt.,Full Metal Jacket

93058,Full Metal Jacket ice and wildfire order and chaos is intellectual war hard thought.,Full Metal Jacket

86879,As Mozart Tom Hulce though extremely American in looks and voice gets better and better as the drama progresses.,Amadeus
86879,This dark exuberant epic is nearly 18 years old yet remains the most popularly successful film ever to render the inner life of an artist.,Amadeus
86879,Reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar ambitious as well as playful brilliant as well as down and dirty -- just like Amadeus himself.,Amadeus

87843,Sergio Leones languid lovely and lengthy ode to Lower East Side mobsters (more specifically mobster films) ...,Once Upon a Time in America
87843,Leone is less interested in arousing an audiences easier emotions than in presenting at a dispassionate distance the horror of two men warily walking toward each other on a tightrope suspended above the snake pit of their  deepest compulsions.,Once Upon a Time in America

87843,A disappointment of considerable proportions.,Once Upon a Time in America

81398,Theres no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas. During fight sequences the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world however briefly from La Mottas perspective.,Raging Bull
75686,This is the link between Allens earlier funnier stuff and more probing works like Interiors and Manhattan. Would that we all could build such masterful bridges.,Annie Hall
75686,Personal as the story he is telling may be what separates this film from Allens own past work and most other recent comedy is its general believability.,Annie Hall

86197,Moviegoers seeking a grand yet edifying entertainment right-stuffed with what Kaufman calls seriousness of subject matter and a wild humor that comes out of left field now know where to look...,The Right Stuff

82096,Wolfgang Petersens direction is an exercise in pure craftsmanship.,Das Boot (The Boat)

82096,Youre drawn in powerfully as the crew members experience a psychologically maddening cycle of lull and storm.,Das Boot (The Boat)
82096,Suspenseful when it needs to be and intelligent in its depiction of the horrors of war and the sweaty claustrophobia of submarine life. On occasion its even -- pardon the pun -- deep.,Das Boot (The Boat)
70735,Newman and Redford pass a few facial expressions between them and try to cool each other out. If there ever was much of a script it can be said to have gone to waste.,The Sting

70735,Top-notch entertainment.,The Sting
70735,The film ends up relying on different chapter headings to explain whats going on but its all very professional with fine attention to period detail.,The Sting
70735,The film is so good-natured so obviously aware of everything its up to even its own picturesque frauds that I opt to go along with it.,The Sting
70735,The movie has a nice light-fingered style to it.,The Sting
67185,The fact that [it] isnt very funny and like its 80-year-old heroic long outlives its necessary life is less important than the fact that the characters frequently react gently or like credible human beings to the scripts impossible notions.,Harold and Maude
67185,Simpleminded but its fairly inoffensive at least until Ashby lingers over the concentration-camp serial number tattooed on Gordons arm. Some things are beyond the reach of whimsy.,Harold and Maude
67185,It is most successful when it keeps to the tone of an insane fairystory set up at the beginning of the movie.,Harold and Maude
67185,[Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon] both are so aggressive so creepy and off-putting.,Harold and Maude
67185,The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby filling the place with a cloying sweet smell. Nothing more to report today.,Harold and Maude
67185,Marked by a few good gags but marred by a greater preponderance of sophomoric overdone and mocking humor.,Harold and Maude
427968,I saw this at a festival and hated it then sat through it again a year later and decided it wasnt so bad aside from the god-awful ending.,Trust the Man
427968,Its a pity because few romcoms pull off the basically sympathetic mining of personal vanities and social embarrassment that the film manages in its opening hour.,Trust the Man
427968,Freundlichs outstanding cast (including Garry Shandling Eva Mendes Ellen Barkin Bob Balaban and James LeGros) -- his best since 1997s The Myth of Fingerprints -- glosses over miscalculations with sheer star power.,Trust the Man
427968,Two couples in trouble one with kids another considering them. Writer-director Bart Freundlichs challenge is to stress them and find a resolution to their conflicts in ways that arent banal predictable or witless. And he settles for one out of three.,Trust the Man
427968,The fact that Freundlich tries to put some thoughtful commentary into a formulaic story is commendable but in the end either his faith wavers or the studio intervened.,Trust the Man
427968,I wish the film were true to itself and its quartet of puzzled struggling lovers; their collapse into sitcom idiocy felt uncomfortably close to betrayal.,Trust the Man
427968,A lot more smug and a lot less insightful than writer-director Bart Freundlich apparently assumes and its burdened even more by its surfeit of unsympathetic characters.,Trust the Man
427968,Screenwriter and director Bart Freundlich fails to offer fresh insights into the problems of contemporary relationships and many of his comic targets are easy and conventional.,Trust the Man
427968,Theres nothing terribly wrong with this comedy about the romantic dalliances of four New Yorkers but theres nothing terribly right about it either.,Trust the Man
427968,The people behind this film would not recognize complex honest emotion if it hit them in the face with a frying pan.,Trust the Man
427968,Trying to mimic the Woody Allen films is not a bad thing to do but why not put a spin on it?,Trust the Man
427968,Is this farce drama satire? Who knows?,Trust the Man
427968,This comedy about two self-absorbed New York couples feels like wan Woody Allen.,Trust the Man
427968,Trust the Man has a sketchy overall feel as if Freundlich didnt finish thinking it through.,Trust the Man
427968,Trust the Man is a mildly amusing movie but thats chiefly a result of its stars -- or more specifically its female stars -- elevating the material.,Trust the Man
427968,As faux Woody Allen movies go Trust the Man is one of the more diverting recent entries in the genre with a top-drawer cast well-chosen Manhattan locations and a sharper script than Allen himself has managed in a while.,Trust the Man
427968,In the end youre left feeling a little empty as if youve been eavesdropping on a conversation in a restaurant and neglected to eat your dinner.,Trust the Man
427968,The actors gamely keep up their spirits but the male characters are too one-dimensional and the female characters too bizarrely divorced from reality to be at all engaging.,Trust the Man

50976,Film has superior technical narrative impressive lensing and thesping.,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet)
50976,Its view of a seemingly godless landscape in the grip of plague is still bold and frightening.,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet)
50976,It survives today only as an unusually pure example of a typical 50s art-film strategy: the attempt to make the most modern and most popular of art forms acceptable to the intelligentsia by forcing it into an arcane antique mold.,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet)
50976,Not only highly impressive but thought-provoking relevant and intensely moving in our present nervous times.,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet)
50976,Essentially intellectual yet emotionally stimulating too it is as tough -- and rewarding -- a screen challenge as the moviegoer has had to face this year.,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet)
50976,This is an uncompromising film regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet)
85859,The thematics are rather cloying but the mood -- profoundly relaxed bemused -- eventually conquers.,Local Hero
85859,[Its] loaded with wry offbeat humor and is the sort of satisfying personal picture that is becoming an increasingly rare commodity these days,Local Hero
85859,Forsyth cannot quite tease out of his characters the kind of strange sublety that Powell and Pressburger delivered but it is enough that he and producer David Puttnam succeed in making you realise just how badly this kind of film has been missed.,Local Hero
85859,Here is a small film to treasure a loving funny understated portrait of a small Scottish town and its encounter with a giant oil company.,Local Hero
85859,It demonstrates Mr. Forsyths uncanny ability for making an audience sense that something magical is going on even if that something isnt easily explained.,Local Hero
438488,It brings me very little joy to report that this version of the popular Terminator franchise is silly obtuse and pointless.,Terminator Salvation

438488,This is the worst big budget summer release Ive seen in some time.,Terminator Salvation
438488,Its a fun time at the movies.,Terminator Salvation
438488,Terminator Salvation is a confused humorless grind with nobody from the stars to the set designers prepared to prick its self-importance.,Terminator Salvation
438488,The digital effects are mostly quite dazzling-not just the depictions of towering marauders...but a memorably scary sequence in which a little serpentine robot thats been taken captive thrashes furiously to save its nonlife.,Terminator Salvation
438488,T4 is a mixed bag but its not f------- amateur.,Terminator Salvation
438488,Message to Hollywood: Stop with the time-travel stuff.,Terminator Salvation
438488,McG a music video maven whose previous credits include the Charlies Angels movies directs the action passably well.,Terminator Salvation
438488,Intensity need not be the enemy of personality but in Bales work it too often has been.,Terminator Salvation
438488,Terminator Salvation promised moviegoers a war between the human heart and the cold cruel efficiency of machines. So why then is it so mechanical itself so good at repetition so preprogrammed and clunky?,Terminator Salvation
438488,A good summer movie isnt just an uninterrupted crescendo of cacophony. You need stuff in between the fireballs and the cyborgs.,Terminator Salvation
438488,Terminator Salvation is so programmed so impersonal that it practically dares you to warm to its characters.,Terminator Salvation
438488,One could argue Connors grim demeanor is precisely what a global disaster demands. But Bales turn has a bass-note feel that is anti-charismatic.,Terminator Salvation
438488,The movies only unmitigated pleasure is a too-brief fight scene between Connor and a naked combatant made up to look precisely like Arnold Schwarzenegger the relentless cyborg of the first three installments.,Terminator Salvation
438488,The latest installment in the venerable sci-fi action franchise turns out to be a straight-up war film grim and muscular and thundering and joyless. Its the color of cement and it weighs as much too.,Terminator Salvation
438488,The Terminator franchise was built on thrills imagination narrative emotion believability character development and watchability. Terminator Salvation has plenty of thrills.,Terminator Salvation

79522,Allen serves up a nostalgia that was utterly of its time; he incarnates an idea of the city that even now remains as strong as its reality and refracts his disappointed ideals into high existential crises.,Manhattan
79522,Manhattan is not just Woody Allens dream movie. Wistful as it is witty its his dream of the movies.,Manhattan

79522,Woody Allens great leap forward into character development and dramatic integrity.,Manhattan

79522,Mr. Allens progress as one of our major filmmakers is proceeding so rapidly that we who watch him have to pause occasionally to catch our breath.,Manhattan

97165,Williams who has comparatively little screen time has come to act not to cut comic riffs and he does so with forceful ultimately compelling simplicity.,Dead Poets Society
97165,Story sings whenever Williams is onscreen. Screen belongs just as often to Leonard who as Neil has a quality of darting confidence mixed with hesitancy. Hawke as the painfully shy Todd gives a haunting performance.,Dead Poets Society

97165,Solid smart entertainment.,Dead Poets Society
61722,The emotional elevation of the film is due in no small measure to the extraordinarily engaging performances of Anne Bancroft as the wife-mother-mistress Dustin Hoffman as the lumbering Lancelot and Katherine Ross as his fair Elaine.,The Graduate
61722,Its consistently fleet and funny even as it probes the heady abandon and looming hangover that typified the decade of discontent.,The Graduate
61722,The screenplay which begins as genuine comedy soon degenerates into spurious melodrama.,The Graduate
61722,The film itself is very broken-backed partly because Anne Bancrofts performance as the mother carries so much more weight than Katharine Ross as the daughter partly because Nichols couldnt decide whether he was making a social satire or a farce.,The Graduate
61722,Makes you feel a little tearful and choked-up while it is making you laugh yourself raw.,The Graduate

50212,Part of the success of The Bridge is that its courageous hero is shown from all angles in all kinds of mirrors. He is strong stubborn fallible maniacal silly and wise; and in the end he is pathetic noble and foolish.,The Bridge on the River Kwai

50212,A gripping drama expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.,The Bridge on the River Kwai
50212,For what it is it aint bad though it serves mainly as an illustration of the ancient quandary of revisionist moviemakers: if all you do is systematically invert cliches you simply end up creating new ones.,The Bridge on the River Kwai
50212,A classic example of a film that fudges the issues it raises.,The Bridge on the River Kwai
50212,In my opinion it is one of the two best films to emerge from a very strong decade of cinema.,The Bridge on the River Kwai
50212,Brilliant is the word and no other to describe the quality of skills that have gone into the making of this picture.,The Bridge on the River Kwai
50212,Most war movies are either for or against their wars. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) is one of the few that focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals.,The Bridge on the River Kwai

56801,[Fellini] is that rare sort of artist who can be loved revered and just barely tolerated all at the same time.,8 1/2
56801,The ensuing decades have brought forth a deluge of bogus masterpieces and Fellinis by comparison holds up rather well.,8 1/2
56801,Its opening [has] perhaps the greatest dream scene of all: Marcello Mastroiannis Guido stifled in a silent traffic jam onlookers gazing blankly at him as he rises through the sunroof of his car high into the sky. The rest of the film isnt too shabby.,8 1/2

71315,The hard-boiled private eye coolly strolls a few steps ahead of the audience.,Chinatown
71315,In 1974 a director a screenwriter and a producer (Robert Evans who for once deserves a few of the plaudits hes apportioned himself) could decide to beat a genre senseless and then dump it in the wilds of Greek tragedy.,Chinatown
71315,A new private-eye melodrama that celebrates not only a time and a place (Los Angeles) but also a kind of criminality that to us jaded souls today appears to be nothing worse than an eccentric form of legitimate private enterprise.,Chinatown
71315,It takes a Herculean effort to transform this type into a character and to replace the formula with a story and Chinatowns success in both of these regards is one of the reasons it is universally viewed as a classic.,Chinatown
71315,[Nicholsons] performance is key in keeping Chinatown from becoming just a genre crime picture--that and a Robert Towne screenplay that evokes an older Los Angeles.,Chinatown
43456,The Day the Earth Stood Still may at first look like goofy outdated science fiction but its timeless warnings about violence nuclear confrontation and the difficulties of policing the planet have made it an enduring cultural classic.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
43456,Like most of Robert Wises work this slickly constructed 1951 science fiction film settles squarely in the middle of its genre better than some and worse than others.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
43456,Cast although secondary to the story works well.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
43456,Edmund H Norths intelligent script and Wises smooth direction are serious without being solemn while Bernard Herrmanns effectively alien-sounding score reinforces the atmosphere of strangeness and potential menace.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
43456,Today wistful viewers might ask: Where are Klaatu and Gort when we need them most?,The Day the Earth Stood Still
43456,It is comforting of course to have it made plain that our planetary neighbors are much wiser and more peaceful than are we but this makes for a tepid entertainment in what is anamolously labeled the science-fiction field.,The Day the Earth Stood Still
40897,Treasure of Sierra Madre is one of the best things Hollywood has done since it learned to talk; and the movie can take a place without blushing among the best ever made.,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
40897,John Huston has rarely been in better form than in this 1948 study of gold fever and worse obsessions among an unlikely trio of prospectors...,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
40897,Theres a quite enjoyable yarn buried under the hollow laughter.,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
40897,The movie has never really been about gold but about character and Bogart fearlessly makes Fred C. Dobbs into a pathetic frightened selfish man -- so sick we would be tempted to pity him if he were not so undeserving of pity.,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre

23969,The Marx Brothers best movie...,Duck Soup

81505,A masterpiece.,The Shining
81505,Kubrick has made a movie that will have to be reckoned with on the highest level.,The Shining
81505,As a ghost story and adaptation of the Stephen King novel its largely a failure. On the other hand as an example of directorial bravura and as a study of madness and the unreliable narrator its a brilliant success.,The Shining
81505,Kubrick is after a cool sunlit vision of hell born in the bosom of the nuclear family but his imagery -- with its compulsive symmetry and brightness -- is too banal to sustain interest while the incredibly slack narrative line forestalls suspense.,The Shining
81505,The movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies it sets loose in an isolated situation primed to magnify them.,The Shining
81505,With everything to work with director Stanley Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen Kings bestseller.,The Shining
81505,I fear all work and no play has made Stanley a dull boy.,The Shining

92005,Stand by Me is a small quiet film that walks tall and resonates long after.,Stand by Me
92005,Its perspective is that of a knowing adult which is to say that though the film is frequently affectionate and funny it contains a drop too much condescension to be entirely successful.,Stand by Me
92005,It stands sweet and strong ribald outrageous and funny like its heroes themselves -- a bit gamy around the edges perhaps but pure and fine clear through. Its one of those treasures absolutely not to be missed.,Stand by Me
92005,Stand by Me is a film of honorable ambitions severely compromised by a creeping show-biz phoniness.,Stand by Me
92005,Reiner seems lost in his own cinematic wilderness -- button-down careful almost afraid to move,Stand by Me

92005,The film is so well-observed and so energetically acted by its young cast that mawkishness is kept at bay.,Stand by Me
92005,Rob Reiners direction hammers in every obvious element in an obvious script.,Stand by Me
92005,Its as effective in 2009 as it was upon its initial release and the richness of its tapestry densely woven from human emotions and character interaction ensure it will never lose that relevance.,Stand by Me
22100,Few films are gripping and effective 82 years after their original release but this one surely is.,M
22100,This is a movie that dares to sympathize with a sick person that risks making the monster real and us (in an era when Germanys cinema was still shellacked in canted angles and fanciful shadows).,M
22100,The moral issues are complex and deftly handled: Lorre is at once entirely innocent and absolutely evil. Langs detached modified expressionist style gives the action a plastic beauty.,M
22100,An extraordinary good impressive and strong talker. Again fine work by Fritz Lang and his wife and helper Thea von Harbou.,M
22100,A subversive film or more simply a movie brimming over with the ferment of Langs imagination at its height? You choose.,M

22100,Lorres performance as a desperate killer who insists he cant help himself remains his finest hour on film.,M
22100,Its an impeccable film -- a model of psychological suspense and a stunning display of Langs power and skill.,M
22100,The film grows more unsettling when it becomes apparent that the child killer Beckert is something of a child himself forcing the audience into something beyond complicity something dangerously close to identification.,M
22100,This astonishing movie represents an unsurpassed grand synthesis of storytelling.,M
22100,The film doesnt ask for sympathy for the killer Franz Becker but it asks for understanding: As he says in his own defense he cannot escape or control the evil compulsions that overtake him.,M
92991,Just when things start getting too grisly Raimi rushes in with a hilarious sendup joke to remind us that all this blood and guts is meant in spooky Grand Guignol fun.,Evil Dead 2
92991,Evil Dead 2 is pardon the expression consistently lively -- a ghoulish splatter comedy that uses wildly excessive gore to provoke the kind of shock that lies between a laugh and a scream.,Evil Dead 2
92991,Good acting would not have served the material well since it would have diluted the comedy quotient and made the campy elements seem cheap and cheesy.,Evil Dead 2
92991,A flashy good-natured display of special effects and scare tactics so extreme they can only be taken for laughs.,Evil Dead 2
92991,The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimis aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen though on the basis of this strained effort Id say hes overshot the mark.,Evil Dead 2
92991,Delirious demented and diabolically funny.,Evil Dead 2
92991,Genuine if bizarre proof of Sam Raimis talent and developing skill.,Evil Dead 2
92991,If you know its all special effects and if youve seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2.,Evil Dead 2
92991,The acting is straight out of 50s B movies. The exposition is clumsy the sound track corny the denouement silly. Then again who said bad taste was easy?,Evil Dead 2
77416,Is it as good as its advance word and nine Academy Award nominations suggest? Yes.,The Deer Hunter

107048,[Murray] carries Groundhog Day with his uniquely frittery nonchalance and makes the movie a comic time warp anyone should be happy to get stuck in.,Groundhog Day

107048,Since arriving as a mild success in 1993 Groundhog Day has gradually achieved the status of beloved. The American Film Institute rates it No.34 on its list of all-time funniest movies and its a story that bears frequent repeat viewings.,Groundhog Day

115710,When Bob Rafelson decides to get nasty he really means it.,Blood and Wine
115710,Its a morality play really but dripping with humid sex and violence.,Blood and Wine
115710,The movies own payoff is compelling enough but the project has a weightless feel that limits involvement. Better you give it an hour-and-a-half on video someday surrounded by wine and snacks.,Blood and Wine
115710,Rafelson is so true to his sour vision of crime deception and a rottenness at the core of our natures -- hes as cheerful as a Jim Thompson potboiler -- that we never get a chance to like or care about his characters.,Blood and Wine
115710,Nicholson is good but the movie isnt.,Blood and Wine

403358,For a good hour and change the film is a big toy box that teases you out of the Gloom.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
403358,It has a refreshing Old World take on a never-ending fantasy war between vampires and the forces of light.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
403358,What a rabid beast is Night Watch. What a pungent Russian fantasy-horror cheeseathon.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
403358,This mostly incoherent enormously eccentric helping of mayhem breaks into so many fragments that watching the movie can be a bit like trying to assemble the pieces from several jigsaw puzzles.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)

403358,Goth thrill-junkies will probably get a giddy charge out of this overheated fantasy. The rest of us can have an equivalent experience by putting our brains in a blender and hitting puree.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
403358,Clarity may be lost but rare is the movie that grabs viewers by their throats and never lets go. Bekmambetovs Night Watch is one of the grabbers.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)

403358,Unfortunately by Hollywood standards Night Watch is about three Wookies and two Neos short of convincing. All the gobbledygook is in place but the special effects are minimal and somewhat frustrating.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
403358,The original plan was to remake Night Watch in English and then thought was given to dubbing it. Thankfully both ideas were scuttled as the films Russian-ness and its allusions to post-communist fears and frustrations add greatly to its appeal.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)
403358,Night Watch is shabby chic with hints of Russias great silent-cinema past.,Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)

117666,[Thornton] does wonders with Yoakam who could have played a standard villain but always manages to suggest a man trapped within his prejudices.,Sling Blade

117372,There are many good reasons for going to see The Preachers Wife.,The Preacher's Wife
117372,The Preachers Wife qualifies as old-fashioned Hollywood movie making at its corniest and most saccharine. But the mostly African American cast puts an engaging spin on the chestnut and it works beautifully.,The Preacher's Wife
117372,For a movie that might have offered a new twist of the mistletoe The Preachers Wife delivers the Scrooge-like acceptable market minimum.,The Preacher's Wife
117372,The Preachers Wife is one Christmas picture that actually is in the spirit of the season. Its warm sentimental amusing yet serious bringing fantasy to bear upon the painfully real.,The Preacher's Wife

117372,This movie could have done more but what it does it makes you feel good about.,The Preacher's Wife
117372,Penny Marshalls remake of The Bishops Wife is very uneven -- sometimes sweet or soulful often stiff.,The Preacher's Wife

115988,Then theres always Mr. Scofield bringing an almost unbearable yet entirely believable lightness of spirit to his loathsome character. Its a bold stroke by a great actor making zealotry and evil seem positively beneficent.,The Crucible
115988,I recommend Hytners movie highly but a part of me resists a work that makes the audience feel as noble in our moral certainty as the characters it invites us to deplore. Some part of its power seems borrowed from the thing it hates.,The Crucible
115988,Her cheeks flush her winsome beauty seared with erotic rage Ryder exposes the real roots of the piece. Forget McCarthyism; The Crucible is a colonial Fatal Attraction.,The Crucible
115988,Too bad though that The Crucible fails to probe deeper into the sexual religious and political conditions that can give false accusations so much power -- even today.,The Crucible
115988,I very much admire how Hytner... keeps the pace swift and doesnt fetishize the 17th-century decors and clothes. But I cant help feeling that in more ways than one The Crucible is a period piece.,The Crucible
115988,What happened in long-ago Salem does still seem to matter.,The Crucible
115988,Handsome and well-acted the films ultimate success depends on the heat between Ryder and Day-Lewis and it simply isnt there. The attraction is fatal alright but it certainly doesnt seem mutual.,The Crucible
115988,Neither the establishing dramatic linchpin nor the final conversion of conscience is terribly convincing leaving this pared-down rendition of the original work diminished in power and meaning as well.,The Crucible
115988,Hytner holds the action together with solid unflashy well-paced direction ensuring that this is no mere period piece but a compelling pertinent account of human fear frailty and cold ambition.,The Crucible
115988,Nothing in the movie is quite up to Scofields Danforth. But what a mighty performance that is!,The Crucible
115988,Day-Lewis Ryder and Scofield will be odds-on favorites for Oscar nominations as will the movie itself.,The Crucible
115988,Theres an awful piercing truth in the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis Winona Ryder Joan Allen and Paul Scofield as members of a community destroyed by guilt paranoia and betrayal.,The Crucible
115988,This stirring film lets you feel the heat of Millers argument and the urgent power of his kick.,The Crucible
115988,Despite these involving moments The Crucible finally seems too schematic more useful as an allegory than as drama and possibly owing that undoubted popularity to its simplistic qualities as much as its insights into group psychology.,The Crucible
115988,With a head on its shoulders and the rawest emotions in its craw Arthur Millers stage hit The Crucible has become a cinematic grabber for grown-ups -- without that castor oil taste.,The Crucible
115988,This version illuminates the storys numerous strengths resulting in a motion picture of surprising emotional and intellectual impact.,The Crucible
115988,Though Hytner remains essentially a stage director he makes fine use of Massachusetts locations and period interiors; some of the visual details recall Dreyers Day of Wrath a film that likely had an influence on Millers play,The Crucible

84726,Star Trek II is a very satisfying space adventure closer in spirit and format to the popular TV series than to its big-budget predecessor.,Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan
84726,If only director Nicholas Meyer had grasped the implications of his tale more fully and enthusiastically this might have become a classic piece of cornball SF poetry but as it stands the tepid acting and one-set claustrophobia take a heavy toll.,Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan
84726,The net effect between embarrassed guffaws is incredulity: a movie at once post-TV and pre-DW Griffith.,Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan
84726,Although I liked the special effects in the first movie they were probably not the point; fans of the TV series wanted to see their favorite characters again and Trek II understood that desire and acted on it.,Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan
84726,Here comes a sequel thats worth its salt. The second Star Trek movie is swift droll and adventurous not to mention appealingly gadget-happy. Its everything the first one should have been and wasnt.,Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan
84726,Star Trek II added hefty doses of action adventure and suspense injecting life into a concept that had been left moribund by its first big-screen feature.,Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan
88170,These are classic directorial occasions and Nimoy rises to them with fervor in effect beaming his film up onto a higher pictorial plane than either of its predecessors.,Star Trek III - The Search for Spock
88170,An emotionally satisfying science fiction adventure.,Star Trek III - The Search for Spock
88170,This 1984 films few and unimpressive special effects evidently qualify it as science fiction but the genre it really belongs to is the male weepie: there hasnt been a gooier buddy romance on the screen since Joe Buck took Ratso Rizzo to Miami.,Star Trek III - The Search for Spock
88170,Decent SFX but a little more action wouldnt have gone amiss.,Star Trek III - The Search for Spock
88170,This is a good but not great Star Trek movie a sort of compromise between the first two.,Star Trek III - The Search for Spock

268695,The film is weirdly disjointed and uncertain as to tone.,The Time Machine
268695,Simon Wells whose other films include the animated The Prince of Egypt and Balto manages to gut all the gee-whiz from the practically foolproof time-travel genre -- despite being H.G.s real-life great-grandson.,The Time Machine
268695,Midway through the movie just when it seems that it might amount to something interesting were suddenly transported to the set of a very bad remake of Planet Of The Apes.,The Time Machine
268695,... unlike the shiny machine at its center its timing is off and it never quite soars.,The Time Machine
268695,... theres something wrong with a time-travel movie that allows an audiences interest to drift so that we have time to worry over where hes parked and whether he remembered to take his key.,The Time Machine
268695,... an agreeable time-wasting device -- but George Pals low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs.,The Time Machine
268695,Its doubtful there will be a Time Machine 2 in our movie future.,The Time Machine
268695,The worst news isnt that this Time Machine is lacking in humanity. Its that screenwriter John Logan has been given the job of writing the next Star Trek movie Nemesis. That is bad news for the Enterprise gang.,The Time Machine
268695,Not exactly H.G. Wells but sturdy and effective.,The Time Machine
268695,Everything else that the filmmakers have done in their thoughtless lazy way to improve the original formula serves only to leach the drama and excitement out of the underlying story.,The Time Machine
268695,The Time Machine isnt so much an adaptation of H.G. Wells seminal novel as it is an appropriation. The film borrows liberally from the book but doesnt treat it with much respect or affection or even understanding.,The Time Machine
482606,The Strangers has a couple of scares but its not anywhere near as frightening as advertised. The creepy folks of the title are more fumbling than fiendish.,The Strangers
482606,This suspense film by first-time writer-director Bryan Bertino initially squeezes some surprisingly effective scares out of familiar elements. Sadly the scenario quickly becomes attenuated and unbelievable.,The Strangers
482606,At least its short.,The Strangers
482606,A sadistic unmotivated home-invasion flick.,The Strangers
482606,Dont let the attractive cast the slick look or the inspired by true events nonsense mislead you. The Strangers is a despicable and mean-spirited practical joke.,The Strangers
482606,Kind of like what The Shining might be if you took out the ESP. And the ghosts. And the chilling atmosphere. So call it The Sucking.,The Strangers
482606,I like watching snakes eat mice just as much as the next fella maybe even more but The Strangers turns the gobble-em-up into an ordeal. Its a fraud from start to finish.,The Strangers
482606,With no plot to speak of no character development whatsoever no theme and precious little intrigue what we have here is simply a pileup of effects. And not especially special effects.,The Strangers
482606,Bertino relies too heavily on occasionally nonsensical terror tricks that every horror buff has seen a million times since John Carpenters Halloween set the standard for domestic fright-night mayhem.,The Strangers
482606,Lets give writer-director Bryan Bertino credit. He knows how to frame a shot to make characters seem vulnerable. Now for his next trick he just needs to turn his talents toward something that isnt repulsive.,The Strangers
482606,Its intense but not necessarily fun and may disappoint less sophisticated horror fans. However for die-hard supporters of unsettling peeks into the dark side of human nature this is a welcome excursion.,The Strangers
482606,Fans of the pitiless/merciless killers school of horror should get a jolt out of The Strangers a harrowing real-time tale of an assault on a remote country home.,The Strangers
482606,Writer and first-time director Bryan Bertino wastes his taut tense premise -- two lovers three villains one house -- by depending on wearingly familiar tricks.,The Strangers
482606,Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness young filmmaker Bryan Bertinos debut is such a careful straight-faced knockoff of 70s exploitation films it plays like a parody.,The Strangers
482606,Every silence pause and sudden noise startles -- and the results frankly are more frightening than the graphic torture scenes in movies like Hostel and Saw.,The Strangers
482606,After a while the suspense starts seeping out of The Strangers because you realize thats all theres going to be to the movie.,The Strangers
482606,A frightfully effective chiller.,The Strangers
482606,It sounds stupid enough and ultimately is but the director Bryan Bertino stages The Strangers early scenes with spooky panache.,The Strangers
482606,Its an efficiently made appropriately terrifying film downright minimalist in approach and all the more horrifying for it. Its so basic its believable.,The Strangers

106266,A one-joke sketch that doesnt work as a feature.,Amos & Andrew
106266,Cage is the only actor allowed to do riffs on his assigned part something he takes full advantage of; the others are stuck with their two-dimensional satirical profiles which grow increasingly tiresome and unyielding.,Amos & Andrew
106266,A hhandicapped satirical farce whose roots are not in life but in other better movies and sitcoms.,Amos & Andrew
106266,A very funny little film with big pleasures and a most promising debut.,Amos & Andrew
106266,Although the movie strives mightily to teach its lesson which is that you cannot judge a man by the color of his skin the humor is undermined by the sadness of the basic situation.,Amos & Andrew
106266,Cage is a font of funny character weirdness. This movie marks the least of his offerings. Jackson as the relative straight man has little to work with.,Amos & Andrew
106266,If nothing else at least the movie offers laughs without being offensive.,Amos & Andrew
106387,As the outsider who courts the mentally ill Mary Stuart Masterson Johnny Depp renders a startling performance that elevates the romantic fable way above its writing and directing shortcomings; look for the young Julianne Moore in a small part.,Benny & Joon
106387,Its acted out in the secondary emotional register of the glass menagerie: whimsical delicate idiosyncratic barmy.,Benny & Joon
106387,Mr. Depp may look nothing like Buster Keaton but there are times when he genuinely seems to become the Great Stone Face bringing Keatons mannerisms sweetly and magically to life.,Benny & Joon
106387,The cast is defeated by a cloying Barry Berman script that Jeremiah Chechik directs with the same flair for the obvious he brought to National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.,Benny & Joon
106387,The movie suggests that love and magic can overcome madness and for at least the length of the film I was prepared to accept that. Much of the credit for that goes to Depp...,Benny & Joon
106387,Riddled with insufferably contrived zaniness ... it deals as deeply with mental illness as The Sound of Music explored the genocidal advance of the Third Reich.,Benny & Joon
106387,[Chechik] has crafted Benny & Joon not as a seamless whole but as a tumble of scenes. Unfortunately too many of them are inspired by Charlie Chaplin Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton and they seem to spill from the screen like Bozos from a kiddie car.,Benny & Joon
106387,Benny & Joon tries to get by on quirkiness alone and while something this offbeat frequently carries a unique kind of appeal it needs stronger characters than Sam and Joon.,Benny & Joon

119937,Though it is always pleasant and agreeable this film has the bland and undemanding texture that characterizes movies made for network TV.,Prefontaine
119937,James tries too hard to bring closure to Pres life and as a result strays a little too far into melodrama. The tearful reminiscences at the end not to mention some of the stuff at the funeral lay it on thickly.,Prefontaine
119937,The Super-16mm film stock gives the film a grainy look that blends in artfully with the vintage videotape of ABCs 72 Olympics coverage.,Prefontaine
119937,Even through Prefontaines obviousness we feel its force.,Prefontaine
119937,Here is a sports movie in the tradition of the best sportswriting where athletes are portrayed warts and all. You do not have to be nice to win races but you have to be good.,Prefontaine
119937,With hypnotic blue eyes and dirty blond hair Leto captures the rock-star style Prefontaine affected and he looks natural in fiery performances on the track as well as off where Pre affected a brash confrontational style.,Prefontaine
119640,A ham-fisted fitfully amusing lark that quickly runs aground.,McHale's Navy
119640,By the end this soporific comedy makes 105 minutes feel more like a two-year hitch.,McHale's Navy
119640,A useless movie. Not funny suspenseful moving or even offensive enough to want to torpedo. Just devoid of any conceivable value.,McHale's Navy

119225,An engaging look at a mangy day in the lives of two junkies trying to kick Gridlockd would have been a good mid-level B.O. performer even without the interest surrounding it due to the recent death of co-star Tupac Shakur.,Gridlock'd
119225,The &#64257;lm has a fairly uninteresting narrative motor in its thriller subplot but hits on an edgy black comic tone for Stretch and Spoons increasingly pained dealings with the unsympathetic representatives of authority.,Gridlock'd
119225,The film seems so fresh its almost possible to forget that it is a fraud in its description of the culture of hard drugs.,Gridlock'd
119225,The movies appeal lies largely in its capacity for surprise riffing off tired characters and pooped genres to produce intermittently at least a fresh new tone. Call it junkie humour.,Gridlock'd
119225,Cast against type as the gentler of two musician junkies trying to burrow through the bureaucracy to enter a rehab clinic in Detroit Shakur has the relaxed screen presence of a young Wesley Snipes and plays perfectly off the delirious Tim Roth.,Gridlock'd
119225,A surprisingly light-hearted comedy about what happens when two self-imposed exiles from society decide to go straight and look to the system for a little help.,Gridlock'd
119225,This is grim material but surprisingly entertaining and it is more cause to mourn the recent death of Shakur who gives his best performance as Spoon a musician who wants to get off drugs.,Gridlock'd
119225,Gridlockd is refreshing because its different. The subject matter isnt new but the approach and tone are.,Gridlock'd
119225,A smart well-made buddy film about two junkies desperate to kick the habit.,Gridlock'd
118111,This 1997 comedy may be amusing if you feel a pressing need to feel superior to somebody but the aim is too broad and scattershot to add up to much beyond an acknowledgment of small-town desperation.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,A madcap gem.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,The comedy has the slow burn of a richly nuanced and non-judgmental character study.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,Where This Is Spinal Tap took rock music and the media as its focus - fat juicy targets just asking to be lampooned - Guests target here is small-town provincials.,Waiting for Guffman

118111,Priceless.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,A sly and gleeful comedy showcase that pokes clever fun at the American musical amateur theatricals and anything else thats not nailed down.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,The originality and audacity of the film written by Guest and Levy is what holds us. They never lose the conceit that the documentary filmmakers and not themselves are the ones who made this movie.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,There is such a thing as comic momentum and Guest has a good sense of what that means. Comic momentum doesnt refer to nonstop jokes but to an atmosphere that is always ripe for humor.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,The nonstop amusing mockumentary Waiting for Guffman does to small-town acting troupes what This Is Spinal Tap did to heavy-metal bands.,Waiting for Guffman
118111,Attention is paid not simply to funny characters and punch lines but to small nudges at human nature.,Waiting for Guffman

116754,Bodrovs movie turns this barren no mans land into an extraordinary stage.,Prisoner of the Mountains (Kavkazskiy Plennik)
116754,The performances that Bodrov drew from a mostly amateur cast of Muslim villagers -- most of whom have never seen running hot water let alone a movie camera -- are alone worth the price of admission.,Prisoner of the Mountains (Kavkazskiy Plennik)
116754,Lyrical and evocative Prisoner of the Mountains represents a balanced and telling examination of the absurdity of war.,Prisoner of the Mountains (Kavkazskiy Plennik)

119887,Pic exists solely to showcase Leguizamos wild and crazy antics which are very much an acquired taste.,The Pest
119887,When Mr. Leguizamo isnt doing third-rate ethnic parody he is wallowing in scatological jokes that are so poorly prepared and executed that they make similar antics by Mr. Carrey play like classic routines.,The Pest
119887,Talented and versatile actor-comedian John Leguizamo indulges himself so totally with incessant mugging mimicking and all-around showing off that he begins to wear out his welcome before the opening credit sequence is over.,The Pest
119887,This film is utterly without discipline or focus in a way that -- to ones shame --one eventually finds oddly endearing.,The Pest
119887,Obviously someone must have told Leguizamo hes a comic genius. Whoever did that isnt his friend.,The Pest
119887,Its the kind of movie where every paying customer deserves to receive a handwritten apology from the producers.,The Pest

120434,Ill lay you 3-to-1 odds that by the end of this flick even fans will be thinking that this wasnt a trip worth taking.,Vegas Vacation
120434,There is nothing more memorable about Vegas Vacation than the flatness of the writing in Elisa Bells script and the uninspired direction of first-timer Stephen Kessler.,Vegas Vacation

120036,Although it increasingly succumbs to a tendency toward conventional movie heroics John Singletons fourth film tells a story of rare interest and tragedy...,Rosewood
120036,The need to bear witness against atrocity to testify that something wicked this way came is the powerful drive that animates Rosewood the story of an American tragedy so horrific no one talked about it for more than half a century.,Rosewood
120036,Rosewood is startling infuriating painful history played out as a not-very-satisfying overly ambitious and overlong movie.,Rosewood
120036,Neither the films smug white bigots nor its uniformly noble blacks are well served by such oversimplification.,Rosewood
120036,Its doubtful a viewer of any race will be unshaken by this horrifying look back during Black History Month.,Rosewood
120036,If the movie were simply the story of this event it would be no more than a sad record. What makes it more is the way it shows how racism breeds and feeds and is taught by father to son.,Rosewood

206634,What I find particularly irksome about it is its pseudo-humanism and its calculating political correctness.,Children of Men
206634,Its a wow.,Children of Men
206634,A superior sci-fi thriller and the best doomsday drama since 28 Days Later.,Children of Men
206634,Despite the bleakness of its vision Children of Men is also thrilling both for its groundbreaking style (there are action sequences here unlike any filmed before) and its complex vividly realized ideas.,Children of Men
206634,Cuaron does lowdown takes on high concept better than anyone; no matter what genre he touches he brings grit and loose-limbed humor along with the hand-held camera jangles.,Children of Men
206634,Darkly poetic throughout the film starts with an explosion and ends drifting in fog with no clear resolution in sight. How brave and oddly satisfying.,Children of Men

206634,A stylish mish-mash of dystopian cliches.,Children of Men
206634,At times the film is so supercharged that it glosses over the storys thematic richness and turns into a very high-grade action picture. But if thats the worst thing you can say about a movie youre doing all right.,Children of Men
206634,Cuaron also pulls us deep into the engrossing universe he has created. There is a stark absence of gadget porn in this futuristic adventure; the most advanced device we see is a video game innovation at its most trivial.,Children of Men
206634,Thrilling important and invigoratingly bleak Children of Men is one of the very best movies to come out in 2006.,Children of Men
206634,Even if you dont buy the main conceit the scumbled texture of the movie makes it feel not just plausible but recognizable and Cuaron takes care never to paint the future as consolingly different.,Children of Men

119174,This 1997 thriller is fairly entertaining nonsense if all youre looking for is 128 minutes of diversion. But if youd like something more from David Fincher the director of Seven dont get your hopes up.,The Game
119174,Regardless of how far one chooses to buy into The Game -- and the ending ambiguously suggests that it could go on and on -- there is no doubt as to Finchers staggering expertise as a director and his almost clinical sense of precision.,The Game

119174,A crowd-pleasing pip most of the way.,The Game
119174,Douglas is the right actor for the role. He can play smart he can play cold and he can play angry. He is also subtle enough that he never arrives at an emotional plateau before the film does and never overplays the process of his inner change.,The Game
119174,As its unspooling on screen the film is hugely entertaining but there are several significant plot holes that grow wider the more closely theyre investigated.,The Game
119174,Fincher is still working on the assumption that he has better things to do than entertain an audience. Which would be fine if he werent drawn to such schlocky material.,The Game
119174,Its like the most hideously overproduced episode of The Twilight Zone on record complete with a last twist that pretty much reduces what came before to soap bubbles.,The Game
119174,Douglas who delivers a new shade of cruel elegance each time he plays another urbane monster is the ideal star for this vigorously contrived thriller.,The Game
119174,The Game is an intensely exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller the kind of movie that lets you know from the start that its slyly aware of its own absurdity (which is why it can then get away with it).,The Game

119349,Its unfortunate that as capable a team as director Lee and screenwriter-producer Schamus should have become fascinated with such unpromising material.,The Ice Storm
119349,Despite its mordant undertones the film is often satirical and frequently very funny and quietly observant in its performances.,The Ice Storm
119349,Over and over again in Austen [Lees] framing his course of action his editing suited and amplified the essence of the scene. But here everything in his directing absolutely everything is banal.,The Ice Storm
119349,Lee daringly chooses to keep his storys motivational mysteries unexplained leaving this richly observed film open to the viewers assessments. Yet the sense of imbalance is ever-present and strong.,The Ice Storm
119349,I dont know when Ive seen actors realize so many affecting moments in such a muddled conception. Lees aestheticized approach is its own kind of ice storm.,The Ice Storm
119349,This is one of those films in which nothing seems to be happening but in retrospect when its over everything seems to have happened.,The Ice Storm
119349,Perceptively detailed in both the directing and acting The Ice Storm commands strictest attention from start to finish.,The Ice Storm

118842,The third time out is the real charm for writer-director Kevin Smith.,Chasing Amy
118842,Neither PC nor crudely anti-PC this tough and tender movie like its characters is prepared to take emotional risks and the comic book milieu is deftly sketched in.,Chasing Amy
118842,Amusing and appealing.,Chasing Amy
118842,Instead of cool twenty-something irony Smith startles us with raw emotional honesty.,Chasing Amy
118842,The script moves beyond Smiths customary cataloguing of male adolescent ignorance and idiocy to offer sharp insights into the romanticism and pragmatism pride and double standards that define the tangled threesome.,Chasing Amy
118842,Can a script exploring some truly deep questions about human sexuality and emotions be any shoddier and wooden? Will Miramax continue to fund one of the worst directors in the business? Dont stay tuned.,Chasing Amy
118842,Its a rude blast of gleeful provocation a farce about emotional pain a drama about sexual slapstick.,Chasing Amy
118842,Work of such fierce intelligence and emotional honesty that it blows away the competition when it comes to contemporary romantic comedy.,Chasing Amy

118842,The script eventually gets beyond the pop-culture jokes and starts dealing frankly and intelligently with the problems of three people who are defined by their pasts.,Chasing Amy
118842,As Chasing Amy redefines the boy-meets-girl formula for a culture where anything goes including perhaps another boy or girl it thrives on Smiths dry deadpan direction.,Chasing Amy
118842,What Smith does best in Chasing Amy is write clever raunchy and emotionally true-to-life dialogue particularly in the arguments between Holden and Alyssa.,Chasing Amy
118842,Often funny but ultimately wrenching,Chasing Amy
118842,Lacks insight and finesse and feels like a boldfaced Rorschach for Smiths own hang-ups.,Chasing Amy
118842,It could prove to be as bad a date movie for some couples as it might be a real turn-on for others. Anyone with set ideas about sex roles or orientations is likely to get steamed.,Chasing Amy

119280,Centering on a lesser-known chapter in the reign of Queen Victoria this richly detailed drama about her intimate relationship with her servant that scandalized the country is extremely well-acted; Judi Dench deserves an Oscar nomination,Mrs. Brown

119280,Mrs. Brown transcends its period setting not only with a keenly observed struggle between love and duty but also with the kind of controversy that envelops the Queen and her servant.,Mrs. Brown

120176,The picture is moderately diverting. But its never much fun.,The Spanish Prisoner
120176,It...has an appealing ironically rarefied look that the filmmaker measures out carefully in a story that begins with a seaplane and ends with a ferry.,The Spanish Prisoner
120176,Mamet keeps the settings simple breeding mistrust out of the flat walls and corporate colors. He concentrates on dialogue and character and this movie is warmer and much closer to psychological realism than the weirdly schematic House of Games.,The Spanish Prisoner
120176,The Spanish Prisoner is for anyone who likes to think and feel along with the characters. Mamet offers us the same clues he gives to Joe; we can piece the truth together along with him.,The Spanish Prisoner
120728,Sharp-eyed and charming.,The Last Days of Disco
120728,The pleasures in The Last Days of Disco come when the friends rant and quarrel and sulk and circle each other with an unstable mixture of need and resentment.,The Last Days of Disco
120728,In spite of itself -- in spite of Stillman -- this is a lively and often endearing entertainment.,The Last Days of Disco
120728,[Stillman] nails his characters with perfectly heard dialogue and laconic satire.,The Last Days of Disco
120728,In its last hour the picture becomes more clumsy and tiresome but the stray laugh and the disco sound keep it pulsing.,The Last Days of Disco
120728,The combination of sharply-realized dialogue and infectiously energetic dance sequences keeps The Last Days of Disco from losing steam.,The Last Days of Disco
120728,If this film ... doesnt fully rise to the lovely vibrancy of Barcelona it still extends the witty quizzical style of Stillmans social comedies onto inviting new terrain.,The Last Days of Disco
124718,Lacking the moral indignation and militant politics of Lees former work this vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama is soft at the center but its one of the most accessible films Lee has made and Denzel Washington is terrific.,He Got Game
124718,At the end of Mr. Lees movie all you feel is the distraction of Mr. Lees stylistic exhibitionism without which I concede he might not be regarded as a genius in some quarters.,He Got Game
124718,[Lee] gets a charming performance from Allen who in his acting debut occupies his pedestal with grace and diffidence.,He Got Game
124718,As usual Lee tries many kinds of stylistic effects and uses wall-to-wall music (by Aaron Copland and Public Enemy); whats different this time is how personally driven the story feels.,He Got Game
124718,Most scenes play too long with a surplus of ideas textures tones and characters and after 134 minutes its clear Lees problem with closure hasnt gone away.,He Got Game
124718,Washingtons Jake Shuttlesworth looks tough and hard an odd but refreshing turn for an actor long associated with handsomely heroic roles.,He Got Game
124718,A two-hour air ball.,He Got Game
124718,Washington is so consistently effective an actor that it hardly needs be said that his excellent performance as the beleaguered Jake carries the film.,He Got Game
124718,The movie is a volatile combination of ambitious mythmaking and nasty reality and like most of Spike Lees work it is also an inextricable combination of good and bad.,He Got Game
124718,an effective companion piece to Hoop Dreams and Blue Chips.,He Got Game
124718,Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen delivers nothing less than the best performance ever put on film by a pro athlete.,He Got Game
124718,The years first Hollywood movie to burst with palpable feeling.,He Got Game
124718,Lee is a long way from the size and scope of his best film Do the Right Thing but at least he is working on a subject he cares about and is doing it with polish.,He Got Game
124718,He Got Game is Lees best film since Malcolm X.,He Got Game
124718,Lee may never have the narrow focus to sustain a film on storytelling alone and he may never need it. What he has here is an explosion of spectacular gambits and a great high-concept hook.,He Got Game
124718,The wildly uneven script includes both disciplined lively riffs and amateurishly artificial exchanges.,He Got Game
124718,Spike Lees He Got Game is gripping in spite of itself.,He Got Game
124718,He Got Game is a little too sappy to be a great movie but it puts the ball in the hole.,He Got Game
119196,Robert Altman the up-and- down director meets John Grisham the constant mediocrity. Just where in our hypothetical picture should we place that unlikely scene?,The Gingerbread Man
119196,Altman had a fine time composing difficult shots through screens bushes and sheets of rain and Chungweis images sometimes delicate sometimes harsh stick with you long after youve forgotten their context.,The Gingerbread Man

119196,Theres great pleasure in watching a movie in which the director has thought out everything beforehand.,The Gingerbread Man
119196,The Gingerbread Man isnt any more profound than other thrillers but the distinctive talents of director Robert Altman make it a lot more potent.,The Gingerbread Man
119196,Although The Gingerbread Man is a finely-tuned example of mainstream entertainment and holds the audiences interest for most of its running length it is a little disappointing.,The Gingerbread Man
119196,Unless one counts a few running gibes against lawyers that can easily be imagined coming from Grisham Altman basically chooses to treat this hackneyed story straight.,The Gingerbread Man
119196,With unexpected success Robert Altman plays a John Grisham mystery in a seductive new key.,The Gingerbread Man
119196,That it seems a step up from sensationalism is because Grisham has a sure sense of time and place and Altman and his actors invest the material with a kind of lurid sincerity.,The Gingerbread Man
118819,The overall purpose of Live Flesh the latest and reputedly most mature work from Spanish bad-boy director Pedro Almodovar remains engigmatic.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
118819,Almodovar whose work here has newly sophisticated polish appreciates the dark twists of this story along with the eroticism that bring heat to all the scheming.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
118819,Despite his erotic fixations Pedro Almodovar is the cinemas last true innocent.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
118819,I can only conclude that the people who think Flower and Live Flesh represent the new mature Almodovar think that his earlier pictures were immature.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
118819,This is the first Almodovar movie that could be called boring.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
118819,Like the gorgeous cinematography (which is used to good effect to eroticize a sex scene) this is all part of Almodovars stylistic package. Never has it been more impressive than here where everything (not just the flesh) is vibrant with life.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
118819,Almodovar seems more assured here confident that he can interest us without overt winking and tomfoolery.,Live Flesh (Carne tremula)
120906,Theres an idiosyncratic talent at work here with the potential to blossom into bigger better and more accomplished films.,Zero Effect
120906,Kasdans is a very promising debut its own dearth of feeling offset by able writing engaging playing and a sure sense of pace.,Zero Effect
120906,It turns out to be disappointingly ordinary.,Zero Effect
120906,Try as it might Zero Effect just doesnt amount to much.,Zero Effect
120906,This is one of those movies that creeps up on you insidiously gathering power. By the end I was surprised how much I was involved.,Zero Effect
120906,Both Mr. Pullman and the slyly restrained Mr. Stiller keep their characters entertaining even when Mr. Kasdans interest is elsewhere.,Zero Effect
120906,Kasdan is onto something but he needs to develop it. If he tries to bring Daryl Zero back for a sequel maybe hell have a better idea of what to do with his eccentric private eye.,Zero Effect

118577,A comedy without laughs an expose without point.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,What turns the witlessness rancid is the way the movie is saturated in the very corruption it thinks its ridiculing.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,A caustic but under-funny expose of the venality of the motion picture business.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,If you harbor an interest in watching so-called industry smarts autodestruct this carries a certain morbid appeal but thats about the extent of it.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,Burning is too good for such a wretched fiasco; only a surgical nuclear strike could suitably destroy what has to be one of the most enervating comedies ever made.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,The picture is just a spoof getting by on wit and a parade of celebrity cameos. Within its modest scope it pretty much succeeds.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,A spectacularly bad film -- incompetent unfunny ill-conceived badly executed lamely written and acted by people who look trapped in the headlights.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
118577,Incidentally its a bad idea to try bailing out hopelessly flat comedy with outtakes that are funnier than the in-takes manage to be.,"An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn"
138563,This patchwork portrait is hard to look away from partly because it exposes how one man rationalizes the dirty job of being a documentary filmmaker.,Kurt & Courtney
138563,In the end too weve learned very little about Cobains demons --- his alleged chronic stomach pains from stress etc. --- or why he and Nirvana became so important to so many people,Kurt & Courtney
138563,[A] funny angry provocative film.,Kurt & Courtney
138563,Unreliable and categorically unfriendly to Love though it is Kurt & Courtney is thoroughly watchable in a bad car accident trash TV kind of way.,Kurt & Courtney
138563,When Kurt and Courtney veers into speculation and gives voice to bizarre and unreliable witnesses it reeks of tabloid excess.,Kurt & Courtney
138563,In all of Broomfields films you meet people you can hardly believe exist.,Kurt & Courtney
138563,Mr. Broomfield doesnt ultimately prove or even believe that Mr. Cobain died under incriminating circumstances. But he makes it wrenchingly clear why the world in which he lived had become impossible to bear.,Kurt & Courtney
138563,Lurid and freakishly arresting.,Kurt & Courtney

120265,The talk flows persuasively; the picture pulses with art and humanity.,Taste of Cherry (Ta'm e Guilass)
120265,Kiarostami is in no rush but the respect and love he shows for his characters and the confidence and simplicity of his technique make Taste of Cherry a satisfying experience.,Taste of Cherry (Ta'm e Guilass)
120265,Kiarastomi like no other filmmaker has a vision of human scale that is simultaneously epic and precisely minuscule.,Taste of Cherry (Ta'm e Guilass)
120265,As the films design becomes clear to us a quiet spaciousness begins to inhabit it.,Taste of Cherry (Ta'm e Guilass)

141986,Kopples discreet quietly revelatory style creates a fine balance between public and private personae that veers more pointedly toward the personal in an incongruous but fascinating coda.,Wild Man Blues

141986,Its hardly a revelation but Allen emerges as genuinely neurotic. Hes also funny.,Wild Man Blues
141986,[Kopples] made a greatly enjoyable film but you cant help wondering if shes fallen under her subjects spell.,Wild Man Blues
141986,[Kopple] might seem an unlikely choice for this material but no doubt her track record gained Allens trust.,Wild Man Blues
141986,Wild Man Blues has a tendency to become repetitious especially during the final forty minutes.,Wild Man Blues

120609,...crude and bloody but effective action comedy...,The Big Hit
120609,As low- intelligence entertainment goes this film is very much a hit-and-miss affair.,The Big Hit
120609,Insatiable moviegoers are advised to wait till this action-comedy written by Ben Ramsey thuds into video stores; tasteful moviegoers will avoid it altogether.,The Big Hit
120609,In its non-A-list way The Big Hit is the most successful attempt yet to transfer the Hong Kong action movie to Hollywood.,The Big Hit
120609,The characters in these movies exist in a Twilight Zone where thousands of rounds of ammunition are fired but no one ever gets shot unless the plot requires him to. The bullets have read the screenplay.,The Big Hit

1010048,Its Oliver Twist by way of City of God.,Slumdog Millionaire
1010048,The best movie of 2008.,Slumdog Millionaire
1010048,Slumdog Millionaire a film so upbeat and colourful that by the time youre relaying its infectious air of optimism to friends you could forget that it features orphans slaughter organised crime poverty enslavement and police brutality.,Slumdog Millionaire
1010048,Slumdog Millionaire is not the cure for all the worlds ills but it comes close. It solves for instance such endemic global problems as: a) sadness b) lovelessness c) cynicism and d) the waning cultural relevance of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.,Slumdog Millionaire

120211,A light and bright romantic comedy.,Still Breathing
120211,The films success ultimately rests on the couple -- and not once in this film aside from a lot of wispy talk about fate and dreams did I see any reason why these two opposites would be drawn to each other.,Still Breathing
120211,This is a story that has been told many times before but generally with more energy than this.,Still Breathing
120211,A gooey swooning swatch of romantic hyperventilation its queasy charms. And let it be said that surrendering to those charms could be as guilt-inducing as polishing off a pint of Haagen-Dazs chocolate ice cream before lunch.,Still Breathing
118798,Its a sharp brave movie a little ragged around the edges but thats to its advantage.,Bulworth
118798,What gives Bulworth its unique character is that all this silliness is periodically punctuated by cogent carefully thought-out mini-manifestos...,Bulworth
118798,Bulworth works with both urbanity and chutzpah by viewing political puppeteering with an all-purpose jaundiced eye.,Bulworth
118798,As writer director and star Beatty flails all over the screen but hes also made the only recent political satire that draws blood.,Bulworth
118798,A shrewd political observer for decades Beatty has fashioned a hilarious morality tale that delivers a surprisingly potent angry message beneath the laughs.,Bulworth
118798,Bulworth is an angry movie but Beatty is savvy enough to recognize that people respond better to comedies than serious issue films so he has camouflaged his message beneath the surface of this original incisive satire.,Bulworth
118798,Bulworth plays like a cry of frustrated comic rage. Its about an archetypal character who increasingly seems to stand for our national mood: the guy whos fed up and isnt going to take it anymore.,Bulworth
120669,Its certainly distinctive looking at times like Richard Lester put through a postmodernist blender.,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
120669,(Gilliams) vision is too reflexively comic to evoke the shadows of dread in Thompsons writing.,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
120669,Pic serves up a sensory overload without any compensatory reflection on the outlandish and irresponsible behavior on view.,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

131436,A waste of time.,I Got The Hook-Up
278504,The film represents a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery. Which is to say that Nolan makes you feel the end-of-the-earth bleakness of his setting makes you feel the way it can discombobulate people once they internalize it.,Insomnia
278504,With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch the movie might have tipped too far Pacinos way. But Robin Williams is a shockingly effective counterweight.,Insomnia
278504,Scene by scene screenwriter Hillary Seitz follows director Erik Skjoldbjaergs original closely but this remake deepens and improves upon the Norwegian film by giving Dormer a more complex relationship with Eckhart.,Insomnia
278504,Nolan uses visual pyrotechnics to pump up the tension and add to Pacinos sense of disorientation but the feeling he evokes isnt as forlorn creepy or ambiguous as in the original (though the mountain wilderness is just as forbidding).,Insomnia
278504,This one is nowhere near as original -- its a flawed remake of a fine first feature from Norway -- but Insomnia still stands on its own as a thriller with brains and scenic beauty.,Insomnia
278504,A dark and fidgety picture from Christopher Nolan who made such a splash with Memento.,Insomnia
278504,The highlight is Pacino who gives his best performance in years.,Insomnia
278504,Despite its linear storyline the film is very recognisably the work of the sharp probing intelligence that gave us Following and Memento.,Insomnia
278504,While it may not be as stylistically idiosyncratic as Memento Insomnia is a gripping highly dramatic thriller that more than confirms the distinctive talent of young Brit helmer Christopher Nolan.,Insomnia
278504,Its a crafty story told with more style and gray areas than your average thriller.,Insomnia
278504,Insomnia is not my kind of arsenic but its so well-made and enigmatic I liked it anyway.,Insomnia
278504,The Hollywood version (which is half an hour longer) transports the action to Alaska and works up a respectable level of bleary-eyed paranoia.,Insomnia
278504,The best thing about Insomnia is that despite director Christopher Nolans soft spot for moody-blues obfuscation he has the good sense to keep his star in practically every shot.,Insomnia
278504,A thriller whose style structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story you cannot separate them.,Insomnia
278504,You see Robin Williams and psycho killer and you think hmmmmm. You see the movie and you think zzzzzzzzz.,Insomnia
278504,This remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise: Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams.,Insomnia
278504,Continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence of good guys and bad and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means.,Insomnia
278504,Pacino his creased face looking like its been aged in a smokehouse is wonderfully bleary as the increasingly confused Dormer.,Insomnia
278504,A haunting psychological drama.,Insomnia
278504,Heres proof that its still possible to make pop-oriented yet personal movies with an A-list cast and a zillion bucks.,Insomnia
200550,The result is underwelming.,Coyote Ugly
200550,A talented young cast in service of a project thats every bit as shrewd as it is shrill and silly.,Coyote Ugly

200550,Its no picnic.,Coyote Ugly
200550,Does Jerry Bruckheimer have the same nagging feeling of deja vu as he compares each new screenplay to those that have gone before?,Coyote Ugly
200550,A movie thats the follow your dream equivalent of singing karaoke along with a DVD of Flashdance.,Coyote Ugly
200550,The father-daughter subplot packs all the emotional heft of Madonnas Papa Dont Preach video.,Coyote Ugly
200550,Coyote Ugly is profoundly stupid earnestly inept at conveying a story and hellbent on wallowing in its shallow emotional manipulations.,Coyote Ugly
200550,A shameless but very watchable piece of youthful romantic fantasy.,Coyote Ugly
200550,An authentically spirited popcorn movie.,Coyote Ugly
200550,Its view of women as objectified but unavailable sex toys is so retrograde it would be maddening if the movie werent such an utter piece of fluff so conceptually barren it might as well be a music video.,Coyote Ugly
120787,...a fast-paced thriller that probably will leave Alfred Hitchcock aficionados mourning its shallowness -- but not until after theyve enjoyed an adrenaline rush.,A Perfect Murder
120787,None of the amusement gained in watching the performances unfortunately amounts to much as the script in a desperate attempt to lend action interest to the original static puzzle plot compounds surprise turn after surprise turn.,A Perfect Murder
120787,What the film lacks is suspense surprise (the new ending is a dud) and passion.,A Perfect Murder

120787,His [Davis] direction is swift and very effective and the movie shot in shades of ebony (the color of black marble) looks exceptionally handsome.,A Perfect Murder
120787,...A Perfect Murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about Dial M for Murder leaving behind the nearly-unwatchable wreckage of a would-be 90s thriller.,A Perfect Murder
120787,You dont have to believe a word of the strained dialogue in A Perfect Murder to be seduced by the movies chilly high-gloss ambiance and its skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knotts play...,A Perfect Murder
120787,Loaded with dramatic irony in the first half and with tension in the second the film gives Douglas another chance to do his slick sinister best; Paltrow a chance to extend her emotional range; and Mortensen a chance to play the chameleon.,A Perfect Murder
120787,What Andrew Davis has essentially done is to take one three-star movie and turn it into another three-star movie.,A Perfect Murder
120787,I think it works like a nasty little machine to keep us involved and disturbed; my attention never strayed and one of the elements I liked was the way Paltrows character isnt sentimentalized.,A Perfect Murder
120787,...snoozy slack...,A Perfect Murder
120787,...theres nothing about this thriller to prevent it from soon becoming enmeshed in the memory with others in which Michael Douglas wears a starched collar and grits his teeth.,A Perfect Murder

120591,Sporadically watchable its at its best at those infrequent moments when it doesnt take itself too seriously.,Armageddon
120591,...the latest in a line of increasingly-stupid action pictures that amazes audiences with flashy special effects and nifty action sequences but leaves them high and dry in both the character and story departments.,Armageddon
120591,It delivers the thrill-ride twists and turns exciting but not surprising.,Armageddon

120591,Even worse is the wildly overrated Affleck whose failings as an actor become glaringly obvious here.,Armageddon

122151,One could argue about which Lethal Weapon is the best but No. 4 is certainly the funniest warmest and most idiosyncratic.,Lethal Weapon 4
122151,The relationship/humour stuff in Lethal Weapon 4 is pretty much excruciating mawkish and inane... The second part of Lethal Weapon 044the action sequences are much better.,Lethal Weapon 4

122151,In short its a mess albeit a weirdly entertaining mess...,Lethal Weapon 4
122151,Given the expectations that constrain it Lethal Weapon 4 is probably the best motion picture that could possibly result from another teaming of Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover).,Lethal Weapon 4
122151,Twelve years later the franchise shows unflagging energy inventiveness humor. 4 rocks.,Lethal Weapon 4
122151,Lethal Weapon 4 has all the technical skill of the first three movies in the series but lacks the secret weapon which was conviction.,Lethal Weapon 4
122718,...this smells like a script slapped together around a toy-product launch.,Small Soldiers
122718,Though it starts promisingly the picture ends as a standoff between the affection Dante and company bring to the project and its increasingly frenetic and tiresome emphasis on what special effects can make its little people do.,Small Soldiers
122718,As with many films in which special effects are the real stars the technology here commands more respect and interest than the material otherwise warrants.,Small Soldiers

138704,Aronofsky who has parlayed this movies Sundance success into two Hollywood deals is that rare indie filmmaker who doesnt want to make hip romantic sitcoms. Hes a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.,Pi

138704,Audacious and bursting with ideas.,Pi

138704,As smart as it is Pi is awfully hard to watch. Filmed with hand-held cameras in splotchy black-and-white and crudely edited it has the style and attitude of a no-budget midnight movie.,Pi
138704,Transports us to a world that is like yet unlike our own and in its mysterious familiarity is eerie intense and compelling.,Pi
138704,It all leads to a very strange place and Im particularly impressed with the economical means both financially and artistically by which Aronofsky gets there.,Pi
138704,The seductive thing about Aronofskys film is that it is halfway plausible in terms of modern physics and math.,Pi
138704,Pi turns what should be a metaphoric relationship into a stupefyingly literal-minded thriller.,Pi

22958,The Nashville of its day Grand Hotels reputation has outgrown its actual quality,Grand Hotel

23876,This is the first big film out of the Fox studio since Sheehans return there and this is a big picture from and on every angle.,Cavalcade
23876,Nary a tear-jerking trick is missed (our family loses one son to the Titanic the other to World War I) and the strangulation is compounded by the staginess since the film.,Cavalcade

64665,I cannot recall a more marvelous pair of acting performances in any one film.,Midnight Cowboy
64665,Midnight Cowboys peep-show vision of Manhattan lowlife may no longer be shocking but what is shocking in 1994 is to see a major studio film linger this lovingly on characters who have nothing to offer the audience but their own lost souls.,Midnight Cowboy
64665,In this film the scenery is lovely and only the human race is vile.,Midnight Cowboy
64665,The acting showy and instinctual is most of the movie; the visual style is too forced and chicly distended to let the drama acquire much natural life of its own.,Midnight Cowboy
64665,Outrageously overrated at the cynical end of the Swinging Sixties.,Midnight Cowboy
64665,What has happened to Midnight Cowboy is that weve done our own editing job on it. Weve forgotten the excesses and the detours and remembered the purity of the central characters and the Voight and Hoffman performances.,Midnight Cowboy

93389,John Lone is superb as the sad mediocrity; and if spectacle finally triumphs over sympathy it is not without a decent struggle.,The Last Emperor
93389,Its a tribute to the films intelligence and its feeling for dialectics that it views both the Forbidden City and the detention center as prisons and that when Pu Yi winds up as a gardener theres a sense of gain as well as loss.,The Last Emperor
93389,The Last Emperor is like an elegant travel brochure. It piques the curiosity. One wants to go. Ultimately its a let-down.,The Last Emperor
93389,Everything involving the life of Pu Yi was a waste. Everything except one thing: the notion that a single human life could have infinite value.,The Last Emperor

95953,Uneven slightly off-target.,Rain Man

95953,Its end effect depends largely on ones susceptibility to the sight of an actor acting nonstop and extremely well but to no particularly urgent dramatic purpose.,Rain Man

95953,Neither Levinson nor Hoffman was able to penetrate the mystery of their subject.,Rain Man
95953,Rain Man is far from a washout but you cant help feeling all those missed opportunities raining down on you.,Rain Man
97239,Alfred Uhrys adaptation of his Pulitzer-prizewinning play aspires more to complex observation of human behavior than to simple moralism about it. Precisely because it has its priorities straight it succeeds superbly on both levels.,Driving Miss Daisy

65063,Whatever its genesis Allens scraggly rhetoric evolved into the dominant comic style of the 70s.,Take the Money and Run
65063,A few good laughs in an 85-minute film do not a comedy make.,Take the Money and Run
65063,It has plenty of hilarious jokes and concepts like the ventriloquists dummies at prison visiting time and the return home from a chaingang break with five shackled cons in tow.,Take the Money and Run
65063,Allen has made a movie that is in effect a feature-length two-reel comedy -- something very special and eccentric and funny.,Take the Money and Run
65063,Woody Allens Take the Money and Run has some very funny moments and youll laugh a lot but in the last analysis it isnt a very funny movie.,Take the Money and Run

67309,For once a genuinely psychological thriller.,Klute
67309,With Fonda and Sutherland you have actors who understand and sympathize with their characters and you have a vehicle worthy of that sort of intelligence. So the fact that the thriller stuff doesnt always work isnt so important.,Klute
67309,Pakula when he is not indulging in subjective camera strives to give his film the look of structural geometry but despite the sharp edges and dramatic spaces and cinema presence out of Citizen Kane it all suggests a tepid rather tasteless mush.,Klute
87995,Repo Man has the type of unerring energy that leaves audiences breathless and entertained.,Repo Man
87995,Coxs style is a step beyond camp into a comedy of pure disgust; much of the film is churlishly unpleasant but theres a core of genuine anger that gives the project an emotional validation lacking in the flabby American comedies of the early 80s.,Repo Man
87995,There are endless things to enjoy from Robby Mullers crisp camerawork to a superb set of performances from witty movie parodies to a tremendous punk soundtrack.,Repo Man
87995,Repo Man comes out of left field has no big stars didnt cost much takes chances dares to be unconventional is funny and works. There is a lesson here.,Repo Man
87995,Its very entertaining and though its rude in an R-rated way it has the good taste never to promise more than it can deliver.,Repo Man
100142,Whit Stillmans crafty independent feature about wealthy Park Avenue teenagers and a middle-class boy who joins their ranks over one Christmas vacation is certainly well imagined and impressively acted by a cast of newcomers.,Metropolitan
100142,Filmmaker Whit Stillman makes a strikingly original debut with Metropolitan a glib ironic portrait of the vulnerable young heirs to Manhattans disappearing debutante scene.,Metropolitan

100142,Like chamber music Metropolitan is sprightly intimate and all too self-aware.,Metropolitan
91369,An innovative mix of sophisticated puppetry and special effects Labyrinth has all the components of classic myth.,Labyrinth
91369,Unfortunately this contemporary (at least for the era) fairy tale directed and co-written by Muppets creator Jim Henson never sets a timely tone beyond the 1980s. It remains disappointingly tethered to yesteryear.,Labyrinth

88847,An iconic movie of the 80s with all the unappealing baggage that suggests.,The Breakfast Club
88847,The Breakfast Club doesnt need earthshaking revelations; its about kids who grow willing to talk to one another and it has a surprisingly good ear for the way they speak.,The Breakfast Club
88847,Mr. Hughes having thought up the characters and simply flung them together should have left well enough alone.,The Breakfast Club
88847,In The Breakfast Club Hughes has created a surprisingly enduring motion picture that is still effective 13 years after its theatrical debut.,The Breakfast Club

120815,For all the care and thoughtfulness that follow in the story I never could shake the impression that all I was watching was every other war film Spielberg had ever seen.,Saving Private Ryan

88814,Its quite good though by the impossible standards the film sets for itself it inevitably falls short.,The Black Cauldron
88814,As usual it is technically excellent but the charm characterisation and sheer good humour that made features like Pinocchio and Jungle Book so enjoyable are sadly absent.,The Black Cauldron
88814,This is the 25th full-length animated feature from Walt Disney studios and professionally put together as it is many of the ingredients may seem programmed to those who have seen some of the others.,The Black Cauldron
88814,The backgrounds are as richly textured and detailed as in any other Disney film.,The Black Cauldron
88814,By the end of The Black Cauldron I was remembering with something of a shock of nostalgia the strength and utter storytelling conviction of the early Disney animators. The Black Cauldron is a return to the tradition.,The Black Cauldron
78869,It is good to see the Disney craftsmen doing what they do best on such a grand and risky scale. If one has time for only one space opera this season this is the one to choose.,The Black Hole

83922,Utterly enthralling.,Fanny och Alexander (Fanny and Alexander)
83922,A fitting introduction to the very personal cinema of this master craftsman not only because it exhibits Bergmans signature themes and stylistic devices but also because it is one of his most life-affirming films.,Fanny och Alexander (Fanny and Alexander)
83922,[Bergman] glides beyond the mere telling of his story into a kind of hypnotic series of events that have the clarity and fascination of dreams. Rarely have I felt so strongly during a movie that my mind had been shifted into a different kind of reality.,Fanny och Alexander (Fanny and Alexander)

48280,Walt Disney has for so long parlayed gooey sentiment and stark horror into profitable cartoons that most moviegoers are apt to be more surprised than disappointed to discover that the combination somehow does not work this time.,Lady and the Tramp
48280,The wider canvas and extra detail work reportedly meant an additional 30% in negative cost. It was a sound investment.,Lady and the Tramp
48280,Disneys imagination seems at a low ebb saddled with a shrunken excessively naturalistic style in line with the diminished possibilities of postwar animation and not yet graced by the inspiration that would redeem that style in Sleeping Beauty.,Lady and the Tramp

104990,Bale and Menken are literally what make the movie sing.,Newsies

104990,This films real trouble lies in its joyless pointless execution.,Newsies
104990,Although the material does indeed involve young protagonists no effort is made to show their lives in a way todays kids can identify with. This movie must seem as odd to them as a foreign film.,Newsies

104990,It looks like its own rehearsal -- an early one at that.,Newsies

118799,Roberto Benignis comic fable about one familys struggle to survive in a Nazi concentration camp is in offensively poor taste.,Life Is Beautiful (La Vita e bella)

91064,What makes The Fly such a stunning piece of obsessive film making is the way Cronenberg deftly allows us to identify with his monstrous creation.,The Fly
91064,Wildly imaginative gut-wrenchingly scarifying and profoundly primal (not to mention funny) David Cronenbergs The Fly is a movie that whacks you in the solar plexus and leaves you gasping.,The Fly
91064,Whats good about the film are the strong performances and the ingenious mostly amusing script. Whats ugly of course is the grossness. And whats bad is the movies inability to reconcile its good and ugly aspects.,The Fly

54167,Peeping Tom reminds us of the scary primitive power of movies by putting us as viewers in the position of its peeping protagonist. As the psychopath sets up his victims for the kill we see them through his eyes.,Peeping Tom
54167,It still packs a wallop. Maybe thats because in cinema were all peeping toms. And the camera in skillful hands can be an exquisite instrument of terror.,Peeping Tom
54167,Stripped of its color and some excellent photography plus imaginative direction by Michael Powell the plot itself would have emerged as a shoddy yarn.,Peeping Tom

90886,Beresford fails to generate sufficient chemistry to bind the performances. Occasional bursts of delicious tragic humour nevertheless make this a not unlikeable feminist mood piece.,Crimes of the Heart

120596,Probably the best that can be said about The Bachelor is that it gave a lot of work to female extras.,The Bachelor

97240,No previous drug-themed film has the honesty or originality of Gus Van Sants drama Drugstore Cowboy.,Drugstore Cowboy
97240,Though hardly earth-shakingly original Van Sants low-budget movie takes a cool contemplative and sometimes comic look at American drug-culture.,Drugstore Cowboy

106856,Douglass intentionally robotic -- and intense -- performance holds its own. Hes scary normal and funny all at once...,Falling Down
106856,Unfortunately it continues on through an uninspired series of cartoonishly brutal social insults each one growing more lethal than the next thereby justifying an increasingly lethal response.,Falling Down
106856,The film ... is actually about a great sadness which turns into madness and which can afflict anyone who is told after many years of hard work that he is unnecessary and irrelevant.,Falling Down
106856,Although it takes a number of wrong turns Falling Down still has the power to disturb.,Falling Down
106856,Falling Down is a brutally manipulative revenge fantasy a piece of comic-strip demagoguery that teeters uneasily on the brink of satire.,Falling Down
82817,Though theres never much doubt how the duel will end the climax is nonetheless surprising and totally satisfying topping the energy of the previous pursuit.,Nighthawks
82817,A terrorist hijacking a cable car even in New York is a mildly ludicrous idea -- were no 747s handy? The plot of Nighthawks makes no sense.,Nighthawks

94012,The crew flings itself energetically through space in search of laughs but it will never penetrate the galaxy where Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein traced their giddy orbits.,Spaceballs
94012,The films low-tech styling is roughly the cardboard inversion of the cinematic machines it parodies and Brooks seems less inclined than usual to push the overkill urges too far.,Spaceballs
94012,Mel Brooks will do anything for a laugh. Unfortunately what he does in Spaceballs a misguided parody of the Star Wars adventures isnt very funny.,Spaceballs
94012,Typically the best conceits end in pratfalls and non-Brooks fans may find that the gravitational pull towards the thumpingly obvious outweighs the wit.,Spaceballs
94012,If it isnt likely to generate what Mr. Brooks himself refers to as Spaceballs II: The Search for More Money neither is it anything less than gentle harmless satire that occasionally has real bite.,Spaceballs
94012,How do you review a movie like this anyway? I guess by saying whether you laughed or not. I did laugh but not enough to recommend the film.,Spaceballs
94012,The jokes in the films are all pretty much in the same vein -- you might call it borsch-belt postmodern -- and theyre all on about the same level too.,Spaceballs

82484,These characters and their quest began to grow on me and by the time the movie was over I cared very much about how their lives would turn out.,Quest for Fire

86465,Trading Places also makes Eddie Murphy a force to be reckoned with.,Trading Places
86465,This 1983 film re-creates a screwball comedy format and then eliminates everything but the crudest audience-gratification elements; any incursions into the more morally complicated side of the genre are quickly curtailed.,Trading Places
86465,Trading Places is a light romp geared up by the schtick shifted by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy.,Trading Places

61789,Patrick Ryans novel has been adapted into a screenplay which as directed by Richard Lester substitutes motion for emotion reeling for feeling and crude slapstick for telling satire.,How I Won the War
61789,Dated maybe but Lesters gruesomely black anti-war comedy still looks inventive and manages occasionally to hit home with its blend of surreal lunacy and barbed satire.,How I Won the War
61789,I am afraid Mr. Lester has not added a single discouragement of war but simply a little discouragement toward patronizing too-pretentious films.,How I Won the War
61789,I got no impression from this film that Lester really personally cares very strongly one way or the other about war. It was only a currently fashionable subject a good excuse to make a movie.,How I Won the War

101393,Visually pic often is exhilarating but its shapeless and dragged down by corny melodramatic characters and situations.,Backdraft
101393,Visually speaking the film does pretty well with fire-as-spectacle less well with everything else (Howard tends to trot out fuzzy-toned Spielbergian backlighting on any pretext).,Backdraft
101393,The fire sequences are stunning and the build-up to them complete with blaring sirens and bellowed conversations has an aggressive immediacy.,Backdraft

780516,The problem is that as heist movies go this is about as captivating as watching someone dodge a bus fare. Almost everything about the film is second-rate: the direction the plotting the intrusive modernist production design.,Flawless

780516,There is a nice sense of style and appreciation for tense face-to-face confrontations among characters trying to ignore the temptations around them. Its sort of the opposite of the current robbery flick The Bank Job - all substance and no flash.,Flawless

120910,Its not that the images arent pretty or that great care hasnt gone into them -- its that the sensibility behind them is so icky limited in its conception of beauty to picture postcards and the sort of paintings you see in chain hotels.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Whatever its flaws -- from kitschy cupids to racist centaurs -- at least the first Fantasia had a human touch. The sequel seems cold and mechanical by comparison.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Sixty years after Walt Disneys animators first set cartoons to classical music theyve conjured up seven new sequences for Fantasia 2000. Judging from the often Mickey Mouse results they may have been too hasty.,Fantasia 2000
120910,For introducing children to the joys of classical music the Warner Bros. Bugs Bunny cartoon shorts were far wittier and much less condescending.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Doesnt play like a celebration. In its sentimental yearning for a golden age when another ones upon us it feels a little like a rebuke.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Where else can you see Perlmans hair in such stunning details find Donald Duck as a major character in a Bible story and experience the distinctive mixture of comfort and grandeur that Disney excels in creating?,Fantasia 2000
120910,Those who get to know the spectacular IMAX format with this movie are in for a jumbo treat.,Fantasia 2000
120910,It is stunning in every sense of the word -- stunningly good most of the time stunningly arch some of the time and technically stunning all of the time.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Beautifully designed and presented.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Fantasia 2000 does not soar the way its predecessor did but neither does it plummet to the earth.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Ideally the music and imagery should fuse into something larger than either. It has rarely worked out that way.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Firmly re-establishes that studios leadership in animation at the dawn of the new century.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Not only music made visible. It is a millennial medley to the max.,Fantasia 2000
120910,Splendid entertainment.,Fantasia 2000
120910,A labor of love.,Fantasia 2000
120910,More than lives up to its clever positioning as the first movie of the new millennium.,Fantasia 2000
175880,A wonderful mess.,Magnolia
175880,What this film may have needed to get on its feet is some honest-to-goodness violence.,Magnolia
175880,One of the most enthralling and exhilarating American movies in ages.,Magnolia
175880,All the work is top-notch.,Magnolia
175880,You dont have to like everything [Anderson] does but if you enjoy seeing the walls rattled and the roof raised in the Hollywood citadel youve got to love it.,Magnolia
175880,You could spend three hours snickering at Andersons What the World Needs Now Is Aimee Mann metaphysic. But his vision cuts deeper than a lot of folky bathos.,Magnolia
175880,Magnolia makes it three-for-three for writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson,Magnolia
175880,An impressive piece of work with some fine acting that makes holding our interest for three-plus hours seem easy.,Magnolia

175880,Nearly as impressive as Andersons rapport with his actors is his use of parallel action to juggle their performances.,Magnolia

175880,Sprawling mess of a film.,Magnolia
175880,The botanical implications are apt: Paul Thomas Andersons big showy flower of a movie unfurls brilliantly.,Magnolia
175880,The more you think about Magnolia -- the dry wit the bravura staging the intricate design the wondrous performances -- the better and more unusual the film seems.,Magnolia
175880,Magnolia is the kind of film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy.,Magnolia
175880,Magnolia is Short Cuts with hope. Its my kind of mess.,Magnolia
175880,Unlike the flashy but hollow Boogie Nights or the studied tough-guy attitude of Hard Eight Magnolia grounds its stylistic pyrotechnics with genuine emotion.,Magnolia
175880,Standout performances include those given by Waters Reilly and especially Tom Cruise ferociously alive after sleepwalking through that Kubrick movie.,Magnolia

119079,The heart of Pushkins celebrated classic pumps firm and full in debuting director Martha Fiennes richly textured pic version.,Onegin
119079,Even if grand pathos isnt achieved Martha Fiennes makes a brave and welcome stab at it.,Onegin
119079,There is a cool mannered elegance to the picture that I like but its dead at its center.,Onegin
119079,The films only real flaw -- alas a substantial one -- is that its pace is too deliberate and gets more deliberate as it goes along.,Onegin
119079,Unable to capture either its wit psychological acuity or formal rigor the movie essentially reduces the schematic seesaw narrative to doomy cliches.,Onegin
174204,Stone doesnt show up until the film is half over and seems to be trying rather hard to make up for the lost time.,Simpatico

174204,Improbabilities and all Simpatico still boasts wonderful scenes and a cast that is truly superb.,Simpatico
174204,Its a confounding and unsatisfying film.,Simpatico
174204,The movie is so careless about its horse-selling subplot that its melodramatic payoff feels cheap and abrupt.,Simpatico
174204,Simpatico never pulls together long enough to amount to much more than a series of prematurely aborted encounters scenes from a movie sketched but unfinished.,Simpatico
174204,Warchus accomplished handling and the stars flavorful performances lend Simpatico a bittersweet grace.,Simpatico
174204,Another example of when bad movies happen to good actors.,Simpatico
174204,A movie hobbled by unwieldy visual ideas.,Simpatico
174204,Instead of permitting its characters to be developed naturally Simpatico manipulates them to fulfill the needs of its heavy-handed plot.,Simpatico
174204,Although the central offense of the past is certainly sordid enough its not terribly interesting and no laborious montage can alter that.,Simpatico
151568,[A] beautifully crafted and lively romp around the 1880s stage world.,Topsy-Turvy
151568,Leighs cast are beyond compare and the whole bighearted splendidly droll celebration of the entertainers lot surely stands among British cinemas one-of-a-kind treasures.,Topsy-Turvy
151568,If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan buff you will be in heaven. If you are not the first thing you will need to know is that the film is nearly three hours long.,Topsy-Turvy
151568,The film is a delight and a surprise all the more so since Leigh is associated with gritty working-class stories.,Topsy-Turvy

151568,The performances cut deeper than usual for costume films and the actors once again seem to literally become who theyre playing.,Topsy-Turvy

151568,A consistently delightful superbly timed and impeccably staged wedge of British pop history.,Topsy-Turvy

151568,One of the years best films.,Topsy-Turvy
151568,Youre likely to be moved to tears.,Topsy-Turvy
151568,Though the film runs nearly three hours it gets better as it goes along.,Topsy-Turvy
151568,There is a sense of real very Mike Leighish life in this film that darkens and transforms it. And transfixes us.,Topsy-Turvy
66892,A rather superficial and limited probe of American male sexual hypocrisies.,Carnal Knowledge
66892,The picture has its moments of chilling insight though essentially it is one more quaint early-70s stab at an American art cinema that never materialized.,Carnal Knowledge
66892,This was never quite the major assault on sexism and male chauvinism it set itself up to be.,Carnal Knowledge
66892,Stays within the universe of its characters and inhabits it totally. And within that universe men and woman fail to find sexual and personal happiness because they cant break through their patterns of treating each other as objects.,Carnal Knowledge
66892,In addition to being the toughest comedy since Little Murders and the most imaginative comedy since Catch 22 Carnal Knowledge represents a nearly ideal collaboration of directorial and writing talents.,Carnal Knowledge
64276,Fonda and Hopper it should by this time go without saying give immense performances.,Easy Rider
64276,A film important to and influential in the flower-power late 60s Easy Rider now seems like a narcissistic hodgepodge of travelogue and passion play.,Easy Rider
64276,None of the forced violence lawlessness rapist gratuitous speed aspects of the motorbike clan in this perceptive film.,Easy Rider
64276,The film may be a relic now but it is a fascinating souvenir -- particularly in its narcissism and fatalism -- of how the hippie movement thought of itself.,Easy Rider
64276,[A] simplistic amalgam of travelogue and the zoom lens.,Easy Rider
64276,Hopper Fonda and their friends went out into America looking for a movie and found instead a small pious statement (upper case) about our society (upper case) which is sick (upper case). Its pretty but lower case cinema.,Easy Rider
64276,It plays today more as a period piece than as living cinema but it captures so surely the tone and look of that moment in time.,Easy Rider

125664,This is a movie that testifies in blisteringly persuasive terms to the intense particular genius of Jim Carrey.,Man on the Moon

125664,Thats not a movie its a timeline.,Man on the Moon
125664,Enormously underwritten and unfunny.,Man on the Moon
134119,Familiarity is the watchword of this overblown opus which neglects holes in the plot to play up its postmodern theme of identity as pastiche -- a clear case of the pot calling the kettle black.,The Talented Mr. Ripley
134119,On balance The Talented Mr. Ripley is worth seeing more for its undeniably delightful journey than its final destination.,The Talented Mr. Ripley
134119,Not only is it an elegantly polished affair with top notch performances all round and magnificent camerawork and editing its also acutely aware of how class money and sex shape desire and resentment.,The Talented Mr. Ripley
134119,Its a gorgeously unsettling film. You can hide in the shadows but luminescence exposes who you are and the only escape is into another identity.,The Talented Mr. Ripley

134119,If anybody can create sympathy for the devil the angelic Matt Damon can.,The Talented Mr. Ripley

195945,Next Friday is an extremely funny movie and this is coming from someone who barely cracked a smile during Friday the first installment of this franchise.,Next Friday
195945,Notable chiefly for feeding a stereotype of blacks as shiftless layabouts interested mainly in recreational drugs and irresponsible sex.,Next Friday
195945,The flick could use Chris Tucker co-star of the first Friday AWOL in the sequel. He probably took a look at the script and realized this sequel was no reason to shout T.G.I.F.,Next Friday
195945,Its vulgar and raggy but also very funny.,Next Friday
195945,Isnt quite the picture its predecessor was.,Next Friday
195945,One measure of its desperation and lack of respect for its audience is the frequency with which it labors to wring humor from flatulence and excrement gags.,Next Friday

195945,The real problem with Next Friday is that the whole movie is so ineptly written and directed that its 90 minutes seem to take twice as long.,Next Friday

196857,Play It to the Bone isnt going to be a contender.,Play It to the Bone

120866,Jessica Lange as Tamora the captured Goth queen seethes with sexuality and vengeance.,Titus

120866,This is the film Shakespeares play deserves and perhaps even a little more.,Titus
120866,A brilliant production of a mediocre play.,Titus
120866,While (Taymors) film version isnt exactly a solemn spectacle neither is it much fun.,Titus
120866,Its all plot twists and shock tactics without the poetry and resonance of Shakespeares later work.,Titus
120866,Despite its nearly three-hour running time there are few dead spots.,Titus
120866,The film is striking and original and in its clash of the brutal and the delicately poetic supremely offputting.,Titus
120866,Its a rage that suits a proscenium but nearly chokes a screen with smoke.,Titus
120866,Makes a brilliant case that it is the Shakespeare play for our time a work of art that speaks directly to the age of Rwanda and Bosnia.,Titus

86250,An unashamed study of selfish sadistic criminality and all the better for it.,Scarface
86250,What were Pacinos detractors hoping for? Something internal and realistic? Low key? The Tony Montana character is above all a performance artist a man who exists in order to gloriously be himself.,Scarface
86250,I like it as a kind of B-movie version of The Godfather. There are a lot of classic lines and a handful of memorably horrific scenes ...,Scarface
86250,The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny. It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting.,Scarface
120834,Snow Falling on Cedars is a motion picture of great thematic and visual richness.,Snow Falling on Cedars
