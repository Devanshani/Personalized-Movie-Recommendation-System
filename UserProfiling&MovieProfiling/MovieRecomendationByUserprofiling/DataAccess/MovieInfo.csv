Knowing nothing about Stanley or the Kowalskis' lives, Blanche is shocked to find that they live in a cramped and run down ground floor apartment - which she proceeds to beautify by putting shades over the open light bulbs to soften the lighting - and that Stanley is not the gentleman that she is used to in men. As such, Blanche and Stanley have an antagonistic relationship from the start. Blanche finds that Stanley's hyper-masculinity, which often displays itself in physical outbursts, is common, coarse and vulgar, being common which in turn is what attracted Stella to him. Beyond finding Blanche's delicate hoidy-toidy act as putting on airs, Stanley, a plant worker, believes she may really have sold Belle Reve and is withholding Stella's fair share of the proceeds from them. What further affects the relationship between the three is that Stella is in the early stage of pregnancy with her and Stanley's first child.

They are reluctant to tell anyone not only of their want to get married, but of their relationship. Geneviève believes her mother will think her too young, and would want her to marry someone with better prospects, especially considering her own tenuous financial situation. And Guy is more concerned now about not abandoning his ailing godmother, Aunt Élise, who raised him, and who he looks after along with a young woman named Madeleine. Act 2, told largely from Geneviève's perspective, begins in February 1958. Guy, drafted to fight for the French in Algeria, has been gone for two months, and is expected to be gone for two years. Geneviève rarely hears from Guy. In order to solve their many problems, Geneviève's mother wants her to marry Roland Cassard, a refined and well appointed diamond merchant who travels often for his work but who is devoted to Geneviève whenever he is in Cherbourg. Geneviève, who still loves Guy but who she is slowly losing in terms of him as a person in her mind, has to decide what to do about Roland, especially as it may become more difficult to accept his proposal as time progresses. Act 3, told largely from Guy's perspective, begins in March 1959 upon his military discharge and return to Cherbourg.

His running prowess does earn him the respect of his classmates, especially his running teammates, and to some extent the school administration, if only he maintains what they consider proper gentlemanly decorum, which isn't always the case in their minds. Born in China the son of Christian missionaries, Eric, a Scot, is a devout member of the Church of Scotland who eventually wants to return to that missionary work. He sees running as a win-win in that the notoriety of being fast gives him an added outlet to spread the word of God, while he sees his speed as being a gift from God, and he wants to run to honor God and that gift. This view does not sit well with his sister, Jennie Liddell, who sees his running as only taking away time from his work to God. Harold and Eric's lives do intersect in national races, but it is the 100 meter track event at the 1924 Paris Olympics which the two men and their supporters most anticipate. Beyond the fact that Americans Charles Paddock and Jackson Scholz are favored in the event, the much anticipated head to head between Harold and Eric may be further shadowed by other issues, especially as it affects Eric's Christian beliefs.",postwwi era briton harold abraham eric liddell naturally gifted fast sprinter approach running fit respective life differently son lithuanianjew harold life somewhat privileged life student cambridge us fastest overcome see obstacle face life jew despite privilege word paraphrase old adage often invited trough isnt allowed drink running prowess earn respect classmate especially running teammate extent school administration maintains consider proper gentlemanly decorum isnt always case mind born china son christian missionary eric scot devout member church scotland eventually want return missionary work see running winwin notoriety fast give added outlet spread word god see speed gift god want run honor god gift view not sit well sister jennie liddell see running taking away time work god harold erics life intersect national race meter track event paris olympics two men supporter anticipate beyond fact american charles paddock jackson scholz favored event much anticipated head head harold eric may shadowed issue especially affect erics christian belief,45445,7.2," postwwi era briton, eric liddell, fast sprinter approach running, respective life, differently son lithuanianjew, harold life, privileged life, student cambridge, overcome see obstacle face, life jew, privilege word paraphrase, old adage, isnt allowed, running prowess, earn respect classmate, extent school administration maintains, decorum isnt, case mind, china son, missionary eric scot, member church, want return, missionary work, winwin notoriety, added outlet spread word, god see, speed gift god, honor god gift, jennie liddell, away time work god, harold erics life, national race meter track, event paris olympics, fact american charles, paddock jackson, scholz favored, anticipated head, head harold eric, shadowed issue, especially affect erics, christian belief",52.5,5

Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, though not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided. It is decided that the northwest area of India, and eastern part of India (current day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan (West and East Pakistan respectively). It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.",gandhi thrown off south african train indian traveling first class compartment gandhi realizes law biased indian decides start nonviolent protest campaign right indian south africa numerous arrest unwanted attention world government finally relents recognizing right indian though not native black south africa victory gandhi invited back india now considered something national hero urged take up fight india independence british empire gandhi agrees mount nonviolent noncooperation campaign unprecedented scale coordinating million indian nationwide setback violence protester gandhi occasional imprisonment nevertheless campaign generates great attention britain face intense public pressure weak world war ii continue enforcing will india britain finally grant india independence indian celebrate victory trouble far religious tension hindu muslim erupt nationwide violence gandhi declares hunger strike saying will not eat fighting stop fighting stop eventually country divided decided northwest area india eastern part india current day bangladesh place muslim majority will become new country called pakistan west east pakistan respectively hoped encouraging muslim live separate country violence will abate gandhi opposed idea even willing allow muhammad ali jinnah become first prime minister india partition india carried nevertheless gandhi spends last day trying bring peace nation thereby anger many dissident side finally get close enough assassinate,194516,8.1," gandhi thrown, african train, indian traveling, first class compartment gandhi realizes, law biased indian decides, nonviolent protest campaign, indian south, africa numerous arrest, unwanted attention, world government, black south, africa victory gandhi invited, considered something, national hero, fight india independence, british empire gandhi agrees, nonviolent noncooperation campaign, unprecedented scale, nationwide setback violence protester gandhi, occasional imprisonment, campaign generates great attention, britain face, public pressure, weak world war ii continue, india britain, finally grant india, independence indian celebrate, victory trouble, far religious tension, hindu muslim, nationwide violence gandhi declares, hunger strike, stop fighting stop, country divided, northwest area india, eastern part, current day, bangladesh place, muslim majority, new country, pakistan west, separate country violence, abate gandhi opposed, allow muhammad ali jinnah become, prime minister india partition, india carried nevertheless gandhi, spends last day, bring peace, dissident side, close enough assassinate",96.6667,5

His only friend in the profession is his now retired ex-partner, Mickey Morrissey, who gets Frank a case, his fee solely a percentage of what his clients are awarded. The case should net Frank tens of thousands of dollars by settling out of court, that money which would at least get him back on his feet. It is a negligence suit brought on behalf of Deborah Ann Kaye by her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Kevin Doneghy, against St. Catherine Labouré Hospital, operated by the Archdiocese of Boston, and Drs. Towler and Marks. Kaye was admitted to the hospital for what should have been a routine delivery, but something that happened while Kaye was on the operating room table led to her brain being deprived of oxygen, resulting in permanent brain damage, and Kaye now being in a totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization for the rest of her life. Frank eventually learns that the cause seems to be that Dr. Towler, the anesthesiologist and an expert in the field, used the incorrect anesthetic for the situation. However, all but one person that was in the operating room that day has provided depositions that nothing improper occurred in the operating room. The one holdout is the operating room head nurse, Maureen Rooney, who is not talking, period, to Frank or the other side. Upon seeing the state Kaye is in, Frank unilaterally decides to do what he believes is the right thing by declining the lucrative out of court settlement offered by the Archdiocese and take the case to court. In doing so, he hopes the truth that the hospital and the doctors truly were negligent comes to light. Feeling that this case may be a turning point in his life, Frank has a new spring in his step, enough that he attracts the attention of Laura Fischer, the two who begin a relationship. Despite having whatever the truth is on his side, that truth which he does not know, and having an expert witness of his own, Frank has an uphill battle in that the Archdiocese has retained the services of Ed Concannon, a high priced lawyer who has a large team of associates whose task is to help Concannon and the Archdiocese win at any cost. Concannon's task seems even easier as Judge Hoyle, the presiding judge, is already biased against Frank for taking the case to court.",frank galvin promising boston lawyer bright future ahead incident early career trying right thing led fired prestigious law firm working almost disbarred wife leaving continually drowning sorrow booze now ambulance chasing lawyer preying weak vulnerable bending truth whenever necessary make dollar case last year losing last four friend profession now retired expartner mickey morrissey get frank case fee solely percentage client awarded case net frank ten thousand dollar settling court money least get back foot negligence suit brought behalf deborah ann kaye sister brotherinlaw sally kevin doneghy catherine labour hospital operated archdiocese boston drs towler mark kaye admitted hospital routine delivery something happened kaye operating room table led brain deprived oxygen resulting permanent brain damage kaye now totally vegetative state requiring hospitalization rest life frank eventually learns cause seems dr towler anesthesiologist expert field used incorrect anesthetic situation however person operating room day provided deposition nothing improper occurred operating room holdout operating room head nurse maureen rooney not talking period frank side upon seeing state kaye frank unilaterally decides belief right thing declining lucrative court settlement offered archdiocese take case court so hope truth hospital doctor truly negligent come light feeling case may turning point life frank new spring step enough attracts attention laura fischer two begin relationship despite whatever truth side truth not know expert witness frank uphill battle archdiocese retained service ed concannon high priced lawyer large team associate whose task help concannon archdiocese win cost concannons task seems even easier judge hoyle presiding judge already biased frank taking case court,29850,7.8," frank galvin, promising boston, lawyer bright future, early career, right thing, prestigious law firm working, disbarred wife leaving, sorrow booze, chasing lawyer preying, vulnerable bending, necessary make, dollar case, last year, friend profession, now retired expartner, mickey morrissey, frank case fee, percentage client, awarded case, net frank, dollar settling, court money, least get, back foot negligence, suit brought, behalf deborah ann, kaye sister brotherinlaw, doneghy catherine, labour hospital, archdiocese boston drs towler, mark kaye, routine delivery something happened, kaye operating room table led, brain deprived, permanent brain damage kaye, totally vegetative state, requiring hospitalization, rest life, learns cause seems, dr towler anesthesiologist, expert field, anesthetic situation, person operating, room day, provided deposition, nothing improper, occurred operating, room holdout, operating room, head nurse, maureen rooney, talking period, frank side, seeing state, kaye frank, unilaterally decides belief, right thing, lucrative court settlement offered, archdiocese take, case court, hope truth hospital doctor, come light, feeling case, turning point, life frank new, spring step, enough attracts, attention laura, begin relationship, truth side truth, know expert, witness frank, uphill battle, archdiocese retained, service ed concannon, high priced, lawyer large team, task help, archdiocese win cost concannons task, even easier judge, hoyle presiding, frank taking, case court",100,8

Gay cabaret singer Carole 'Toddy' Todd may befall the same fate as Victoria as he was just fired from his singing gig at a second rate club named Chez Lui. To solve both their problems, Toddy comes up with what he considers an inspired idea: with Toddy as her manager, Victoria, pretending to be a man, get a job singing as a female impersonator.

And what Stone doesn't know is that Carol, has another boyfriend named Earl Mott (Bill Pullman), and they plan to blackmail Sam, by videotaping him disposing of Barbara's body. When Earl goes there to do that, the person who goes there was not Sam but a man with a hooker (Jeannine Bisignano), and he instructs the hooker to scream her head off, Earl mistakenly believes that Barbara's not dead and that Sam was killing her there, and was so freaked out that he didn't bother to see if it was Sam. Carol tries to put her plan in operation by sending Sam a copy of the tape, Sam thinks that it's for something kinky that Carol wants and when Sam tells her that he is going to do what was done on the tape to her, she assumes that he is going to kill her. So she sends another copy of the tape to the Chief of Police (William G. Schilling), and tells him that she wants him to arrest Sam for murdering Barbara, and the Chief is happy to oblige cause he is the man who is on the tape. The Chief manages to find the instruments that Sam was going to use to kill Barbara and arrests him. Sam now has to get Barbara, alive, so that he can prove that he didn't kill her.

However, he focuses more on his corporate raiding pursuits with his partner in crime, Philip Stuckey, his lawyer of ten years, than those women, with every significant other he's had in his life feeling neglected and eventually leaving him, this fact about which he is just coming to the realization. In Beverly Hills, Edward, in needing that woman on his arms as he and Philip work toward taking over the company owned by the increasingly insolvent James Morse, decides, based on a chance encounter, to hire Hollywood Boulevard hooker Vivian Ward as his escort for the week 24/7. He does so because he wants to have a professional who would be committed to the work, yet not have any commitments to her after the week is over. Beyond their chance encounter, he also makes this decision because she surprises him about how unhookerish she is in certain respects. Vivian, relatively new to Los Angeles and the business, still has to look and act the part, with Edward, beyond giving her money, leaving her largely to her own devices to do so.

And Wall Street executive Alberta, who Lucy in particular doesn't like in her life (especially as Alberta and their father have since divorced) is a domineering but admittedly efficient woman who treats her personal life as an extension of her professional life. As time progresses and each woman deals with her own issues while trying to help Rebecca, a hunky house painter who they have nicknamed ""Valentino"" enters their collective lives. ""Valentino"" profoundly affects each of their lives, at the same time that Rebecca, the only one who is seen as having had the perfect marriage, provides what they hope is sage advice for their issues. What comes into question is the appropriate time that Rebecca is allowed to feel sorry for herself.

The virus becomes known as the Motaba virus, and it's so deadly that it causes severe bleeding and liquefies internal organs, killing within 3 days. The virus wipes out Motaba River Valley, and a devastatingly huge fire bomb is dropped onto Motaba River Valley in order to reduce the chances of further infection. The bomb was dropped on the orders of corrupt General Donald McClintock, even though an army surgeon, General Bill Ford, was against the idea. 27 years later, in 1994, there is another outbreak in Motaba River Valley. At the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located at Fort Detrick in Maryland, Colonel Sam Daniels is doing research on the Motaba virus, and so is his ex-wife Roberta Keough, who works at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. A monkey carrying the Motaba virus stows away on a ship that is heading for the USA, and after the monkey's arrival, people in Cedar Creek, California start becoming infected by the virus. Sam and Roberta head into Cedar Creek with fellow doctor Casey Schuler, and they start searching for the monkey, thinking that the monkey is the key to finding a cure. Along the way, Sam stumbles onto some information that may be of help -- McClintock has been concealing vital information from the president of the United States. Since 1967, McClintock and Ford have been in possession of E-1101, a serum that was made to cure the virus. McClintock has been trying to stop Ford from coming forward with this information, and so far, McClintock has succeeded. McClintock now wants to drop onto Cedar Creek the kind of firebomb that was dropped on Motaba River Valley 27 years ago. Sam and Roberta figure out that the virus in the Cedar Creek outbreak is a new strain of the Motaba virus -- an airborne strain that is even more contagious than the flu.

While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room, Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle, and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls, and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high-powered attorneys, Carl wants to be represented by his friend Jake Tyler Brigance, who has a wife named Carla and a daughter named Hannah. Presiding over the trial is white judge Omar Noose, and the prosecution attorney is Rufus Buckley, who would like nothing more than to win the case and swim in the publicity that a win would generate, because Rufus realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office. Helping Jake on the case are his former law professor Lucien Wilbanks, fellow attorney Harry Rex Vonner, and law student Ellen Roark. Ellen has had experience with death penalty cases, and that's exactly what Rufus may be seeking. To start things off, Noose denies bail and denies Jake's petition for a change of venue.

That night, a KKK member is found trying to plant a bomb under Jake's porch. Jake's secretary Ethel Twitty and her husband Bud are also attacked by the KKK.

The company has yet to produce a film, Bobby's personal net worth is virtually zero, and the company only has $2,184 to its name, $1 invested into it personally by Bobby every week since he first decided he wanted to make a movie when he was a child. Bobby believes his fortunes will change when his accountant Afrim changes hats and writes a science-fiction alien invasion screenplay that Bobby thinks all studios will clamor for and has Oscar written all over it. He has a small stable of followers who support his vision in being part of this movie, which eventually includes Daisy as the lead actress, she a stereotypical small town girl looking to make it big in Hollywood. Having just arrived in town, she does not know her way around the Hollywood system,... except on her proverbial back. Bobby is not averse to telling bald-faced lies in his singular focus in getting the picture made and distributed all on this $2,184 as a starting point. It is using several of those lies that he is able to get a verbal confirmation from big studio executive Jerry Renfro to distribute the movie *if* it stars Kit Ramsey, arguably the biggest action star in the world. Using similar lies, Bobby, however, is unable to convince Kit to star in the movie. Kit, who has a weakness for the Laker Girls, is a self-absorbed and paranoid movie star whose life and thus career is largely directed behind the scenes by Terry Stricter, the head of a new age religion called MindHead. Bobby comes up with a scheme that he believes will get around Kit not agreeing to star: film Kit without him knowing that he is being filmed. The only person who knows of the scheme is Dave, Bobby's lowest of low level inside man turned cinematographer who has unofficial (i.e. technically stolen and thus free) access to studio camera equipment and general knowledge of Kit's general day-to-day movements through the studio system. Bobby is able to convince all the other actors that Kit's acting process involves he not interacting with them outside of filming the specific scenes he has with them. Part of Bobby's scheme involves using Kit's general paranoia that aliens truly are invading the planet to get his gut reactions to what is happening within the context of the script. But Bobby knows he has to get Kit to scream the closing lines of the movie ""gotcha suckas"" for the movie to be a success. Complications ensue when another of the the actors, Carol, tries to go against Bobby's policy of not making contact with Kit outside of filming, and when Bobby is required to hire a production assistant cum stunt double cum acting double, whose job in part is to stand-in for the requisite Kit Ramsey naked ass shot.

Typical wallflower Janie too hates both her parents, the three who suffer individually in silence in their home life. Janie tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, she aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Janie's more experienced classmate, Angela Hays.

Although they like most of the women at the WI (the friendship part), they, but the perceived flaky Chris in particular, hold the way Marie, the local president, runs the chapter with derision. They find much of what goes on there, especially the monthly presentations, banal and devoid of enlightenment and fun. Equally as banal was last year's fund-raising calendar, featuring local bridges, which raised a meager £75.60, with this year's proposed calendar, local churches, promising to be even more so. After Annie's husband John passes away from leukemia, Chris wants the WI to provide a memorial in his memory: a new sofa for the family room at the hospital. The one Chris wants to buy costs £999, which she proposes to raise by changing the fund-raising calendar to one featuring tasteful photographs of nude Knapely WI members. She got the idea by seeing all around her the notion of the old adage that sex sells.

To get the project off the ground, they not only have to convince nine other WI members to pose (December to be a group photograph), but they have to find a photographer they trust that will treat this task as an art project.

Josey Aimes takes her two kids, Sammy and Karen, and leaves her abusive husband Wayne, to return to her northern Minnesota home town. On a chance meeting with her old friend Glory Dodge who works as a driver and union rep at the mine operated by Pearson Taconite and Steel, Josey decides to work at the mine as well, work that is dominated by men in number and in tone. She does so to be able to stand on her own two feet for the first time in her life, something she probably could not have done if she remained in a job washing hair at a beauty salon. Working at the mine does not sit well with her father, Hank Aimes, who also works at the mine and who, like the other male workers, believes she is taking a job away from a man. Hank has believed that all Josey's problems are of her own doing, ever since she, unmarried, had Sammy while she was still in high school. Josey has always stated that she does not know who Sammy's biological father is, which fosters Hank's attitude about her. Among Josey's coworkers is Bobby Sharp, who many believe is Sammy's biological father. Josey's evangelical mother, Alice Aimes, stands by her husband in their general belief of traditional roles of men and women. Josey and her fellow female mine workers are continually harassed, emotionally, physically and sexually by their male counterparts. Every seeming step forward in the issue Josey finds is only a measure to lull the women into a false sense of security, or to make the fall even harder. Unable to withstand the abuse, Josey decides to sue the company for sexual harassment. She does so with the help of Glory and her husband Kyle's friend, Bill White, an ex-New York lawyer who is facing his own emotional demons.

The energy, compassion, and heat of township life in all its elements create a constantly visually interesting and dynamic background for the unfolding of the story, which owes part of its huge popularity to the thrilling combination of a violent gangster tale with a passionate, almost supernatural love story. As it unfolds, it explores issues of fame and wealth, the position of a strong and independently minded woman in a very masculine society and, perhaps most importantly, the incomprehensible attraction between abuser and victim. Bizet's opera, based on Prosper Merimée's novel, premiered in Paris on March 3, 1875. Set in a poor area of Seville, the story of the magnetic woman who seduces, loves, and ultimately destroys her lover and herself, is well known. Girl (Carmen) seduces boy (Don José), boy becomes completely obsessed, girl leaves boy for another (the Matador), boy in a jealous rage kills her. Carmen's mother-obsessed soldier lover who is displaced by the glamorous matador is one of the greatest tragic figures in all of musical theater. But the story is her story. Why does she push her soldier into violence? Why doesn't she escape at the last moment? What drives her to destruction? Although these fascinating aspects of human relationships are explored in a penetrating and at times uncomfortable way, this is no intellectual journey but a bawdy, passionate, and vibrant tale with enormous warmth and heat, and some of the greatest tunes ever written. The fantastic vitality and huge skill of the performers from Dimpho Di Kopane make an impact beyond that achieved by any filmed opera to date. The soundtrack, recorded by Dimpho Di Kopane with Imbumba, a young South African orchestra, combines Bizet's score with traditional South African music, which creates a powerful musical experience.",ucarmen feature film based george bizet century opera filmed location modern south african township setting energy compassion heat township life element create constantly visually interesting dynamic background unfolding story owes part huge popularity thrilling combination violent gangster tale passionate almost supernatural love story unfolds explores issue fame wealth position strong independently minded woman very masculine society perhaps importantly incomprehensible attraction abuser victim bizet opera based prosper merimes novel premiered paris march set poor area seville story magnetic woman seduces love ultimately destroys lover well known girl carmen seduces boy don jos boy becomes completely obsessed girl leaf boy another matador boy jealous rage kill carmens motherobsessed soldier lover displaced glamorous matador greatest tragic figure musical theater story story push soldier violence doesnt escape last moment drive destruction although fascinating aspect human relationship explored penetrating time uncomfortable way no intellectual journey bawdy passionate vibrant tale enormous warmth heat greatest tune ever written fantastic vitality huge skill performer dimpho di kopane make impact beyond achieved filmed opera date soundtrack recorded dimpho di kopane imbumba young south african orchestra combine bizet score traditional south african music creates powerful musical experience,598,6.7," ucarmen feature film based, george bizet century, opera filmed, location modern, african township, setting energy, compassion heat, township life element create, dynamic background, unfolding story owes, part huge popularity, thrilling combination, violent gangster tale passionate, supernatural love, story unfolds explores, issue fame wealth position, minded woman, very masculine society, importantly incomprehensible attraction, abuser victim bizet, opera based, paris march, poor area, seville story, magnetic woman seduces love, girl carmen seduces boy, don jos boy becomes, obsessed girl, leaf boy, boy jealous rage, kill carmens, soldier lover, glamorous matador, tragic figure, musical theater story story, push soldier violence, doesnt escape, last moment drive destruction, human relationship, penetrating time, uncomfortable way, intellectual journey bawdy passionate, vibrant tale, enormous warmth heat, greatest tune, fantastic vitality, huge skill performer dimpho di, kopane make impact, filmed opera date soundtrack recorded, dimpho di kopane imbumba, orchestra combine bizet score, african music, musical experience",100,5

Never one to run with the crowd, Bella never cared about fitting in with the trendy, plastic girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother remarried and Bella chooses to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she didn't expect much of anything to change. But things do change when she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen. For Edward is nothing like any boy she's ever met. He's nothing like anyone she's ever met, period. He's intelligent and witty, and he seems to see straight into her soul. In no time at all, they are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance - unorthodox because Edward really isn't like the other boys. He can run faster than a mountain lion. He can stop a moving car with his bare hands. Oh, and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. That's right - vampire. But he doesn't have fangs - that's just in the movies. And he doesn't drink human blood, though Edward and his family are unique among vampires in that lifestyle choice. To Edward, Bella is that thing he has waited 90 years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. Somehow or other, they will have to manage their unmanageable love. But when unexpected visitors come to town and realize that there is a human among them Edward must fight to save Bella?
